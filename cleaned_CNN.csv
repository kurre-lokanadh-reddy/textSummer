"it is  official  american . president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria.  obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.  the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force ""to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.""  it is  a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.  there are key questions looming over the debate  what did united nations . weapons inspectors find in syria  what happens if congress votes no  and how will the syrian government react   in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday, the president said he would take his case to congress, not because he has to    but because he wants to.  ""while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" he said. ""we should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.""  obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september  . the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday, sen. robert menendez said.  transcript  read obamas full remarks  syrian crisis  latest developments  u.n. inspectors leave syria  obamas remarks came shortly after united nations . inspectors left syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb.

""it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,"" nesirky said.  he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria, and that ""a military solution is not an option.""  bergen   syria is a problem from hell for the american .  obama  'this menace must be confronted'  obamas senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the presidents comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria. some american . lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.  some global leaders have expressed support, but the british parliaments vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obamas hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies.  on saturday, obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar al assad. any military attack would not be open ended or include american . ground forces, he said.  syrias alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month ""is an assault on human dignity,"" the president said.  a failure to respond with force, obama argued,  ""could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.""  syria missile strike  what would happen next   map  american . and allied assets around syria  obama decision came friday night  on friday night, the president made a last minute decision to consult lawmakers.  what will happen if they vote no   it is  unclear. a senior administration official told cnn that obama has the authority to act without congress    even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.  obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al assad government.  he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech.  ""the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime    and others who would consider using chemical weapons    that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,"" the white house said.  meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in, american . military officials said they remained at the ready.    key assertions  american . intelligence report on syria  syria  who wants what after chemical weapons horror  reactions mixed to obamas speech  a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obamas announcement.  ""our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,"" said spokesman louay safi. ""so we are quite concerned.""  some members of congress applauded obamas decision.  house speaker john boehner, majority leader eric cantor, majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president.  ""under the constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with congress,"" the republican lawmakers said. ""we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.""  more than   legislators, including   of obamas fellow democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a ""full debate"" before any american . action.  british prime minister david cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week, responded to obamas speech in a twitter post saturday.  ""i understand and support barack obamas position on syria,"" cameron said.  an influential lawmaker in russia    which has stood by syria and criticized the united states    had his own theory.  ""the main reason obama is turning to the congress   the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the us or in the united states itself,"" alexei pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the russian state duma, said in a twitter post.  in the united states, scattered groups of anti war protesters around the country took to the streets saturday.

""the syrian armys status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,"" wael nader al halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy, according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obamas address.  an anchor on syrian state television said obama ""appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies.""  a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel, turkey, some arabs and right wing extremists in the united states.  ""i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament,"" said bashar jaafari, syrias ambassador to the united nations.  both obama and cameron, he said, ""climbed to the top of the tree and do not  know how to get down.""  the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august   attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.  british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than  .  on saturday, obama said ""all told, well over  ,  people were murdered."" american . secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of  , , more than   of them children. no explanation was offered for the discrepancy.  iran  american . military action in syria would spark  would isaster'  opinion  why strikes in syria are a bad idea","syrian official  obama climbed to the top of the tree, ""does not  know how to get down"". obama sends a letter to the heads of the house and senate. obama to seek congressional approval on military action against syria. aim is to determine whether cw were used, not by whom, says united nations . spokesman.

""i am  proud of myself and i will  continue to work to dominate for as long as possible,"" bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the   rio olympics.  victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from ashmeade, while gatlin and the united states third leg runner rakieem salaam had problems.  gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with bolt.  earlier, jamaicas women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the  x m relay gold, anchored by shelly ann fraser pryce, who like bolt was completing a triple.  their quartet recorded a championship record of  .  seconds, well clear of france, who crossed the line in second place in  .  seconds.  defending champions, the united states, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between alexandria anderson and english gardner, but promoted to silver when france were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover.  the british quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their mens team.  fraser pryce, like bolt aged  , became the first woman to achieve three golds in the     and the relay.  in other final action on the last day of the championships, frances teddy tamgho became the third man to leap over  m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold.  germanys christina obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the womens javelin after five previous silvers, while kenyas asbel kiprop easily won a tactical mens  m final.  kiprops compatriot eunice jepkoech sum was a surprise winner of the womens  m.  bolts final dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the united states there was criticism of the poor attendances in the luzhniki stadium.  there was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist yelena isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of russias new laws, which make ""the propagandizing of non traditional sexual relations among minors"" a criminal offense.  she later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the   winter games in sochi, the next major sports event in russia.",usain bolt wins third gold of world championship. anchors jamaica to  x m relay victory. eighth gold at the championships for bolt. jamaica double up in womens  x m relay. 
"kansas city, missouri  cnn     the general services administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsas kansas city, missouri, office, a cnn investigation has found.  it cost more than   ,  for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year.  he is among several hundred gsa ""virtual"" workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years.  under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they are  actually assigned.  the kansas city employee, who started his job in january  , is paid   ,  and works from his home in honolulu, a gsa representative confirmed.  in the past year, according to gsa travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. four of those trips were to st. louis; four were to washington, with a side trip to cincinnati; and one was to san diego. the total cost to taxpayers was   , .  jason klumb, the gsas regional administrator for kansas city, defended the hire.  ""the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants,"" klumb said. ""and when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred.""  klumb called the gsas teleworking program ""a successful program thats going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers.""  but a gsa spokeswoman said, ""we are not going to defend this type of travel.""  and a gsa employee in kansas city, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous.  ""it does not  make sense,"" the employee said. ""when you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area. it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least   percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington, d.c., where a lot of business is done.""  dan tangherlini, who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program.  ""i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case,"" he said. ""if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they are  providing, and you have  got to give me the business case. you have  got to explain to me why thats a cost effective move for the american people, and thats a new standard that we are  asking everyone at gsa to adhere to.""  the gsa ""virtual employee"" program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including cnns parent company, turner broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion.  the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsas teleworking program in june. that followed disclosures that   virtual employees, including   in supervisory positions, spent nearly   ,  in travel costs between october   and june  .  ""the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,"" according to a letter from committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r california, to the gsa.  the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee. cnn also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material.  the general services administration, which has more than  ,  employees and a   .  billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement. congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector generals report issued this year showed lavish spending      ,     at the agencys western regions conference in las vegas in october  .  the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa.  jeff neely, the gsa official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agencys administrator, martha johnson. two of johnsons deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. tangherlini, a former treasury department official, took over as acting gsa administrator.  in addition to the las vegas conference, the gsa apparently spent   ,  to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner. and   gsa employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff    all subjects of inspector general investigations    are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than    million in taxpayer money.  in july, a cnn investigation revealed that the gsas kansas city office spent more than   ,  to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free spending culture that went on for years at the gsas kansas city regional headquarters.  gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agencys practices are under a top down review.  cnns sara anwar, elizabeth m. nunez and tom cohen contributed to this report.  watch erin burnett weekdays  pm et. for the latest from erin burnett click here.","the employee in agencys kansas city office is among hundreds of ""virtual"" workers. the employees travel to and from the mainland american . last year cost more than   , . the telecommuting program, like all gsa practices, is under review.

"los angeles  cnn     a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in  , when she examined him as part of a team of doctors.  dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada.  ""i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case,"" stancheva told cnn in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkharts role in it.  stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with ""autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression."" the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said.  stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis.  burkhart, a   year old german national, has been charged with   counts of arson following a string of   fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at   locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities.  stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of  .  ""i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression,"" she said.  burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing.  prosecutors said his ""rage against americans,"" triggered by his mothers arrest last week, motivated his ""campaign of terror"" with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities.  burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriffs deputies to hold him up.  the district attorney called his courtroom behavior ""very bizarre.""  ""this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of   arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community,"" los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. ""the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans.""  carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a   .  million bond and surrender his german passport.  it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany.  the worst arson sprees in the citys history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said.  no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach    million, authorities said.  cooley called it ""almost attempted murder,"" because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines.  the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were ""caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire,"" cooley said. ""if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant.""  ""in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings,"" a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. ""the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep.""  investigator edward nordskogs affidavit detailed burkharts behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother.  ""while in the audience, the defendant  burkhart  began yelling in an angry manner, 'f  k all americans.' the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy american . marshals,"" nordskog wrote.  dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the   year old german woman is wanted on   counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said.  the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in  , meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between   and  .  ""it is my opinion that the defendants criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible,"" nordskog wrote.  a search of burkharts hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september,  , the investigator said.  ""it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states,"" nordskog wrote.  burkharts mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january  . meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.","new  a canadian doctor says she was part of a team examining harry burkhart in  . new  diagnosis  ""autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression"". burkhart is also suspected in a german arson probe, officials say. prosecutors believe the german national set a string of fires in los angeles.

" cnn     four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said thursday they will challenge arizonas new immigration law, which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal american . residency.  the mexican american legal defense and educational fund, the american civil liberties union, the aclu of arizona and the national immigration law center held a news conference thursday in phoenix to announce the legal challenge.  ""the arizona community can be assured that a vigorous and sophisticated legal challenge will be mounted, in advance of sb s implementation, seeking to prevent this unconstitutional and discriminatory law from ever taking effect,"" said thomas a. saenz, president of the mexican american legal defense and educational fund, known as maldef.  ""this law will only make the rampant racial profiling of latinos that is already going on in arizona much worse,"" said alessandra soler meetze, executive director of the aclu of arizona. ""if this law were implemented, citizens would effectively have to carry 'their papers' at all times to avoid arrest. it is a low point in modern america when a state law requires police to demand documents from people on the street.""  republican arizona gov. jan brewer signed the law last week. it goes into effect   days after the close of the legislative session, which has not been determined.  brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts.  ""racial profiling is illegal,"" brewer said after signing the bill friday. ""it is illegal in america, and it is  certainly illegal in arizona.""  the national coalition of latino clergy   christian leaders said sunday it also planned legal action.  ""our churches and pastors in arizona are outraged about the significant threat this anti immigrant law will have in the lives of arizonas latinos,"" said the rev. miguel rivera, the groups chairman.  ""this policy violates the rights of american citizens, particularly the fast growing latino population of arizona, by eliminating the basic right of due process, which we are certain that the courts will agree,"" rivera said.  the law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are  in the united states illegally. the measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through arizona illegally.  it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.  in addition to signing the law, brewer also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination.  ""this training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the united states,"" she said.  some officials in arizona have expressed their displeasure with the measure. phoenix mayor phil gordon said thursday that he is ""very disappointed.""  he said he is concerned that calls to boycott arizona businesses and tourism will harm the state.  ""i am  very incredulous that our state leaders    our so called leaders    have allowed our state to be split when we are  suffering economic hardships,"" gordon told cnn.  other critics say the bill is unconstitutional and will trample residents' civil rights.  ""quite simply, this law is a civil rights disaster and an insult to american values,"" said mary bauer, legal director of the southern poverty law center. ""no one in our country should be required to produce their 'papers' or demand to prove their innocence. what kind of country are we becoming ""  but a national republican leader said thursday that arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government.  ""i think the people of arizona have a right to pass their laws under the  th amendment,"" house minority leader john boehner said. ""i think it is clearly a result of the federal governments failure to secure our border and to enforce our laws.""  gordon said the real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that would allow more immigrants to legally enter the united states.  ""this law does not  accomplish that,"" he said. ""it does not  do anything on that.""  president obama has called on congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year. cnn has learned that senate majority leader harry reid and other top democratic senators will unveil the outlines of that legislation late thursday.  but boehner said at a briefing thursday that ""theres not a chance"" that congress will approve the measure this year, especially after the recent passage of a health care reform bill.  ""i have  been out here for a little while and know that in the middle of an election year, after we have  had bills like health care shoved down our throats and the process twisted, tortured, pressured, bribed, you cannot do a serious piece of legislation of this size, with this difficulty, in this environment,"" he said. ""and it is  nothing more than a cynical ploy to try and engage voters, some segment of voters, to show up in this novembers elections.""  the arizona measure has drawn sharp criticism from the mexican government, which issued an advisory to its citizens this week. the secretary general of the organization of american states and some member states also expressed concerns about the law wednesday.  ""this is an issue of concern to all citizens of the americas, beginning with the citizens of the united states, a country with a very rich tradition of immigration and respect for immigrants who have come to lead a better life,"" oas secretary general jose miguel insulza said.

"while labor day is the unofficial end of summer, it is  also the unofficial start to the campaign season.  that means politicking will be on the rise, especially as control of the senate is at stake as well as control of   state houses. so, if you turn on your tv, expect to see more    and nastier    political advertisements. in fact, elizabeth wilner, senior vice president of kantar ad

of the only senate races republicans are at risk of losing, but also the race where the top senate republican is at risk of losing his job.  the republican leader of the senate, mitch mcconnell, is in a fight for his political life against alison lundergan grimes, a relatively inexperienced democratic politician who was just   years old when mcconnell started his first term in the senate in  .  mcconnell, a shrewd politician, prolific fundraiser and expert campaigner, has had numerous missteps, making this race even more interesting. his troubles include a flubbed campaign ad, a campaign manager who was a little too honest, the recent resignation of that manager and a caught on tape moment.  grimes, meanwhile, has also stumbled when talking about foreign policy, and questions have arisen about a possible sweetheart deal involving her campaign bus.  this is one of the most interesting and critical races in the country.  how mitch mcconnell crushed the tea party  here are four other races that are worth watching   wisconsin governor  the wisconsin governors race has many national repercussions, as republican gov. scott walker is locked in a tight re election battle against former trek bicycle executive mary burke.  economic policy is a central component of this campaign.  walker has gained prominence in conservative politics for governing as a fiscal conservative and making deep cuts to spending by cutting public union workers' pensions. he also drastically limited workers' bargaining rights. meanwhile, democrats, backed by labor unions, are again fighting to defeat walker    they forced a recall two years ago that walker won    to move forward on more democratic economic policies, including lifting the minimum wage.  walker, who is also being investigated for alleged illegal campaign coordination with outside groups, is considered a potential   republican presidential candidate, but if he loses his gubernatorial race, his path to the presidency will be very, very narrow.  democrats and republicans understand the stakes, and president barack obama traveled to wisconsin on labor day to speak at a union event in a trip packed with political symbolism.  walker, burke tied up in new poll  u.s. senate, louisiana  democratic sen. mary landrieu always has tough races, and her fourth bid for the senate seat is no exception. republican rep. bill cassidy is the person who is giving landrieu another difficult run.  cassidy is tying landrieu to obama in this conservative leaning state while painting her as a corrupt washington insider. landrieu, meanwhile, is attempting to paint her senate tenure as a picture of independence.  most interestingly, a political roller coaster is possible. if landrieu or cassidy does not  receive more than    of the vote on election day in november, a winner wo not  be named until that states december   election. theres a chance the louisiana race, and the balance of the senate, might be dragged out until december.  sen.

"gaza city  cnn     an italian humanitarian activist and journalist who was kidnapped in gaza has been found dead and one person is in custody, the hamas interior ministry said friday in a statement.  police investigating the case learned where   year old vittorio arrigoni was being held and went to the location, where they found the body, the statement said.  an autopsy revealed that he had been killed hours before police entered the location, it said.  medical sources said his body was taken to shifa hospital in gaza.  the grisly outcome came hours after a video was posted on youtube showing a man identified by his colleagues as arrigoni. a black blindfold covered his eyes; his right cheek appeared red as though it had been hit; his hands appeared to be bound behind his back. a hand belonging to someone outside of the view of the lens appeared to be grasping his hair on the back and pointing the captives head toward the camera.  arabic writing scrolled over the video threatened that arrigoni would be killed if hesham al saeedni, who has been held for nearly a year by hamas, were not released within   hours of   a.m. thursday. al saeedni is the leader of a group that may have been inspired by al qaeda, said alfredo tradardi, the italy coordinator for the international solidarity movement, where arrigoni was a volunteer.  the writing calls italy an ""infidel nation whose armies are still present in muslim lands.""  tradardi, who had initially expressed optimism that his co worker would be released unharmed, told cnn in a telephone interview that the outcome underscores the need for progress to be made toward middle east peace. ""now, we have to work more deeply to try to change the foreign policy of our government, of the european government, of the united states government in order that they could press israel to solve the problem of the palestinians.""  arrigoni had been active in the palestinian cause for nearly a decade, and had been allied with the international solidarity movement for more than two years, ""monitoring human rights violations by israel, supporting the palestinian popular resistance against the israeli occupation and disseminating information about the situation in gaza to his home country of italy,"" the non governmental organization said in a written statement.  he was granted honorary citizenship for his work for the palestinian people, the statement said.  ""vittorio arrigoni is a hero of palestine,"" said a statement released by khalil shaheen, head of the economics and social rights department at the palestinian centre for human rights. ""he was available everywhere to support all the poor people, the victims.""  arrigonis colleagues last saw him about   p.m. wednesday near the port in gaza city, said joe catron, a member of the international solidarity movement.  ""i think he was just the first foreigner they ran across,"" catron said about the abductors. ""it is ironic they happened to come across someone who has dedicated a part of his life to helping palestine.""  arrigoni, who was also working as a freelance journalist, was from the northern italian region of lombardy.  journalist talal abu rahmi, cnns yasmin amer, tom watkins and erin mclaughlin contributed to this story",new  autopsy indicates he had been dead for hours before police arrived. youtube video appears to show the activist bound and blindfolded. the activist and freelance journalist was from the lombardy region in northern italy.

"kathmandu, nepal  cnn     a ferocious leopard may have killed   people in nepal in a   month span, its latest victim a   year old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat.  the head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home saturday morning, said kamal prasad kharel, the police chief of the baitadi district, an area about   kilometers    miles  west of kathmandu.  the grisly discovery, which came after teams of people searched for the child, marks the  th victim in the past   months in that remote district in western nepal.  the police chief suspects that a single man eating leopard is responsible for the deaths. if not, there are at most two of the man eating creatures around, he believes.  maheshwor dhakal, an ecologist at the department of national parks and wildlife conservation in kathmandu, agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man eating animals in one area. most leopards live on wild prey.  more human victims could also be expected if there were more than one or two man eaters around, he said.  ""since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer,"" dhakal said.  kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than  , because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in uttarkhand state in northern india, which borders baitadi district.  ""it could be the same leopard,"" he said.  of the   victims in nepal so far, two thirds are children below the age of  . the others are older children and a   year old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest, a common practice in nepal.  ""no adult male has been killed,"" kharel said.  all the victims are from villages bordering the dense forests in the district, he said.  after killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat.  ""in the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,"" kharel added.  the district administration has announced a rs.  ,   about     reward to anyone who captures or kills the leopard.  the local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police, armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal.  controlling this particular leopard has been a challenge for the wildlife officials in kathmandu.  ""we are sending a veterinary doctor to the district to understand the situation,"" dhakal, the ecologist, said. ""there is no alternative but to kill the leopard.""  the chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed. normally, it is illegal to kill wild animals.  leopards are common in the low mountain areas, as compared to the high himalayas, across the country.  while cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in nepal, this case is ""extreme,"" dhakal said.","a   year old boy is the latest victim of a man eating leopard, a local police chief says. he suspects one leopard is behind the deaths of   people in the past   months. a reward has been offered to anyone who captures or kills the man eating creature. leopards are common in low mountain areas of nepal but usually eat wild prey like deer.

""though i am still uncomfortable with hearing my name and the word 'hero' in the same sentence, i am now ready for the challenge of proudly wearing this piece of blue fabric and carved metal with the same reverence that i wear the bracelet. and i vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so,"" white said.  not long before, obama recalled whites bravery and that of his colleagues.  the president paid tribute to those who died that fall day in afghanistan and those who survived. they had done everything their country could ask for and more.  ""kyle, members of chosen company, you did your duty,"" obama said.

""they knew not to stop, they had to keep moving,"" obama recalled of the group walking single file with a cliff to their right and a steep, rocky slope to their left. ""they were heading into an area known as ambush alley.""  in an interview prior to the award ceremony, white told cnn how the group walked ""down this little incline and looking into the valley,  when  i hear this single shot. then two shots, then the echo, then fully automatic gunfire.""  taking so much fire, members of his patrol were separated as they tried to take cover. white was finishing off his first magazine and beginning to load another one when an rocket propelled grenade exploded, knocking him unconscious.  moments after he came to, an enemy round hit a rock just inches from his head. the shrapnel and rock fragments cut his face.  dazed, he struggled to take in what was happening. he and four others had been separated from the other soldiers, who would  jumped from a cliff. white administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available  a single tree. that soldier would survive.  it was at that point in the attack that white realized his radio was not  working.  he looked out and saw a member of his patrol about   feet away whose wounds were so bad that he could not move. white ran toward him, braving enemy fire.  white was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree.  but the mans injuries were too severe, and he died.  risking death, again and again  white continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors, again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader. white told the military publication stars and stripes that he could see the leaders helmet and assault pack, but he could not  tell whether the leader was alive. white had to see, he said.  white crawled toward the man. it was too late. he was dead.  white figured he would be killed. but he would do what he was trained to do. he would carry out his duty.  ""it was never a choice,"" he explained to cnn. ""i told myself from the beginning that i was going to be killed, you know... just the amount of fire ... i am  not gonna make it through this.""  but he kept focused. the soldier white had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again, this time in the knee, so the white wrapped his belt around the mans leg, creating a tourniquet.  then white found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help.  finally, maybe, there could be hope. but then a friendly mortar round landed near white.  ""i remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head,"" he told stars and stripes.  suffering a concussion, white managed to hang on, waiting for helicopters to evacuate him and others with him that day. when help arrived, he told his rescuers to put the other wounded aboard first.  a soldier, changed  speaking with national public radio this week, white said the experience    from the violence to the wait    seemed like ""forever."" and it has not  entirely gone away, all these years later.  ""it is  something you still think about every day,"" white said. ""i still have these images from that day burned into my head. but it is  something, as time goes on, it gets easier.""  but something inside him changed, he said.  ""even to this day, you know, i ca not  say if it was something good or bad. ..."" he told npr. ""and that was pretty much the reason why i decided to leave the army.""  white first returned home and trained other paratrooopers. when it came time for white to re enlist, he thought hard about whether doing so felt right. he decided against it because he doubted that he could devote his complete heart and mind to it, he told npr.  it was unacceptable to him to continue in the service and then, perhaps, be deployed to afghanistan. service members deserve a leader who is all in, he explained.  obama called him on february   to tell him he would  be given the medal of honor. hes the  th recipient of that award for his actions in afghanistan, and the seventh surviving recipient. four service members received the medal of honor    all posthumously    for actions in the war in iraq, according to the congressional medal of honor society.  in a brief statement to reporters after tuesdays ceremony, white called the medal of honor ""a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood.""  as such, white could not  help but think about his brothers in arms.

""are we doing something because it is  the right thing to do, or because 'it is  the way we have  always done it ' "" a microsoft spokesman asked rhetorically in a statement.  the big product categories that will dominate the ces show floor next week, according to manufacturers and analysts, are not revolutionary. they are expected to be thinner, lighter and more refined versions of gadgets that have already gained a toehold with consumers.  tablets  electronics makers have been chasing after apples ipad for two years, and the racetrack is expected to get more crowded next week.  google and samsung last month released the first phone running android  . , which is googles first system thats designed to work consistently on either a phone or a tablet. at ces, tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software, but the touchscreen tablets with android   will be prevalent.  not to get left out of the party it started about a decade ago, microsoft is stepping up its tablet efforts. the next major version of windows will have a revamped interface for tablet computers, which will present programs as tiles that can be touched to fill the screen.  analysts expect to see a bevy of windows   tablets at ces.  with so many options, bargain hunters may get to pick something besides amazons kindle fire, which lit up holiday sales last month.  the fire actually has quite a bit of android code under the hood. sorry, microsoft.   ultrabooks  windows wo not  be just for tablets, of course. a new breed of computers called ultrabooks will launch at ces from several pc manufacturers.  if the tablet wars are a response to the ipad, then ultrabooks follow in the footsteps of apples macbook air. they are thinner and lighter than the average laptop because they typically do not have disc drives, and instead of hard drives, use flash memory, which is faster but more expensive.  microsoft will enable this anti disc computer with the application store in windows  . but the ultrabook initiative is being driven by intel, which makes the processor that runs them.  ""you have intel pushing heavily on this very thin but relatively traditional clamshell form factor without a lot of emphasis on touch,"" npd group analyst ross rubin said in a phone interview. ""and then you have  got microsoft pushing the touchscreen tablet experience.""  netbooks appear to be on their way out. thats a bad sign for google, whose chromebooks have struggled to challenge microsoft in pc operating systems.  internet tvs that also do   d  tvs have long been the centerpiece of ces and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole. for the last few years, the big push has been in three dimensional viewing technology, but demand has been small.  meanwhile, internet services are also working their way onto television sets. netflix and pandora have seen tremendous growth on tv platforms.  for the   d optimists, app friendly tvs, which also happen to work with   d glasses, could allow for more   d video from independent filmmakers who distribute over the web, rubin noted.  ces is expected to provide a launchpad for tvs that are smarter about how they let watchers access web content, analysts say. google has reportedly invested more in its tv platform, which should be evident at ces.  the electronics giants do not want to get beaten to another big opportunity by apple, which is rumored to be working on a tv set of its own. do not  expect apple to show up at ces with a big screen though. or to show up at all.  connected cars  as the automotive industry strives for a rebound, car makers are looking for high tech to be their guide.  several car companies have lined up ces presentations. they are expected to announce partnerships with popular internet software companies and unveil technical wonders available at the touch of a button on the steering wheel. dieter zetsche, the head of mercedes benz cars, will present a keynote speech tuesday.  mog, the music streaming service, plans to announce integration with a line of cars tuesday. and since last ces, pandora has more than doubled the number of cars that tap into its streaming radio service, pandora founder tim westergren said in a phone interview.  ""these companies see the car as a software platform,"" westergren said. ""it is  the computer on four wheels.""  apps  sure, ces is about gadgets, but the programs that run on them have become a key selling point.  many electronics makers have apparently decided that each new phone, tablet, car or refrigerator should allow owners to update their facebook statuses.  ""software has simply become so critical to the overall customer experience,"" said rubin, the npd group analyst. ""it is  no longer an optional part of the business.""  software makers are eager to exploit this reality. many say they will tout their wares at partners' booths and in private meetings. for example, online video provider vimeo plans to make a major announcement monday to coincide with the start of ces.  vimeo ceo dae mellencamp said in an interview at the companys new york headquarters that ces has emerged as an important venue for her company and others like it. ""it is  the only trade show i attend all year,"" she said.","the consumer electronics show brings a slew of new gadgets. tablets running googles android and microsofts windows   will debut. ultrabooks, a new type of thinner laptop, are expected to make a splash. but some of the largest players in the consumer electronics industry are shunning ces.

" cnn     bayern munich might be licking their wounds after defeat in the european champions league final, but the german club can find comfort in victory of a different kind  by beating chelsea in footballs financial league table.  despite saturdays crushing penalty shootout loss to the english side in their own backyard at the the allianz arena, the bavarians have been ranked as the second most valuable brand in football.  according to a new report by independent consultancy brand finance, which has compiled a list of the   biggest brands in the sport, the four time european champions have been valued at    million.  chelsea, by comparison, made fifth place with a value of    million.  but english giants manchester united lead the way, as in  , with a brand estimated to be worth    million.

""if you look at bayern munich, they are a domestic powerhouse,"" said chattaway.  ""they have got really strong links with strong german brands.  ""bayern have long term deals, they have been with adidas for over   years. they generate the highest commercial revenue and they are able to negotiate the highest possible deals based on their dominance of the german market.""  munich mourns as bayern blow big chance  behind united and bayern are the spanish ""el clasico"" rivals of real madrid, third with a value of    million, and barcelona, with a brand worth    million.  spanish champions real and   european champions barca have seen similar decreases in the value of their brands,    and    respectively, which chattaway puts down to the countrys current economic plight.  ""they have both had relatively successful years on the pitch,"" he said.  ""the eurozone crisis has really impacted the capital in spain and italy. it is  not necessarily something they are doing wrong commercially, it is  a sign of the economy they operate in.""  the top   is dominated by teams from the english premier league, with united and chelsea followed by     title winners manchester city in eighth     million   torres american ure of chelsea future  ""within europe, the premier league is still the pinnacle,"" explained chattaway. ""it still generates the most money because of the broadcast rights.  ""it is much more attractive to a foreign audience than the german bundesliga or the spanish first division. the premier league clubs are benefiting from that.""  italian cup winners napoli     million  were the only serie a club to increase brand value, coming off the back of a relatively successful champions league campaign, to be  nd overall.  ac milan     million  placed ninth on the list after winning the title in    , while this seasons champions juventus     million  fell from  th in   to  th this year.  former england captain david beckham and his los angeles galaxy teammates enjoyed a landmark year in  , being crowned major league soccer champions for a third time.  despite their success, and despite boasting one of footballs most recognizable and marketable stars, the galaxy     million  only crept onto the list in  th position.  ""the game in the american . is still developing massively,"" said chattaway.  ""the revenues are a fraction of those in europe. the games are rarely sold out and the grounds themselves have quite a small capacity.  ""the commercial deals in the american . cannot compete with the european market. the mls is still largely only shown in the american ., it has not  really expanded globally as quickly as we would have expected.""  with such a huge gap between the sports most lucrative brands and those with less commercial appeal, are football clubs making the most of their financial potential   ""i think there is more scope for all the clubs to further maximize value    clubs have traditionally been slow and unimaginative in monetizing the brand they own,"" chattaway said.  ""there is scope for football clubs to learn from american . sports marketing practices.  ""the clubs need to better understand the brand asset that they own so that they can ensure they get the right returns on all commercial deals.""  the list took into account various revenue streams for clubs, such as ticket sales, merchandising, sponsorship deals and money received from the sale of broadcasting rights.  .","manchester united again named footballs most valuable brand. the   time english champions are worth a reported    million. germanys bayern munich second on the list, worth an estimated    million. spanish rivals real madrid and barcelona both see small decreases in brand value.

"washington  cnn     former vice president dick cheney on sunday defended the bush administrations economic record, the invasion of iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists, warning that reversing its anti terrorism policies endangers americans.  ""we have  accomplished nearly everything we set out to do,"" ex vice president dick cheney says sunday about iraq.  in a wide ranging interview with cnns ""state of the union,"" cheney said the harsh interrogations of suspects and the use of warrantless electronic surveillance were ""absolutely essential"" to get information to prevent more attacks like the   suicide hijackings that targeted new york and washington.  ""president obama campaigned against it all across the country, and now he is making some choices that, in my mind, will, in fact, raise the risk to the american people of another attack,"" he said.  critics said the bush administrations ""alternative"" interrogation techniques amounted to the torture of prisoners in american custody, while the administrations warrantless surveillance program violated federal laws enacted after the watergate scandal.  since taking office in january, obama has announced plans to close the american . prison camp at guantanamo bay, cuba, to halt the military trials of suspected terrorists there, and to make cia officers follow the army field manuals rules on interrogations. cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre   model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue, rather than a military problem.  ""when you go back to the law enforcement mode, which i sense is what they are  doing, closing guantanamo and so forth ... they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus thats required, that concept of military threat that is essential if you are  going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks,"" he said.  but rep. joe sestak, d pennsylvania, said the bush administrations policies undercut ""what is actually the source of americas greatness    our principles.""  ""how can we say that keeping a man in a black hole forever    perpetually in a black hole    and saying, 'lets torture when we decide to,' is what america stands for "" asked sestak, a former admiral who led the navys anti terrorism efforts.  the bush administration took office at the end of an economic boom and left in the middle of a deep recession, with a budget surplus in   becoming a    trillion plus deficit by  . but cheney said he and bush had to spend money to deal with the september  ,   attacks, the resulting war in afghanistan, the disaster of  s hurricane katrina, and the costly and unpopular war in iraq, now nearly six years old.  ""all of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend, or were not  originally part of the budget,"" cheney said. ""stuff happens. and the administration has to be able to respond to that, and we did.""  obama has begun to wind down the war in iraq, which has cost more than  ,  american lives and nearly    billion in direct costs. but cheney said the united states has ""accomplished nearly everything we set out to do"" in iraq, including establishing a democratic government in the middle east.  cheney was one of the administrations leading advocates of the   invasion of iraq, pressing the bush administrations argument that iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists. none of those weapons were found after the invasion, but cheney said, ""we have  eliminated that possibility.""  in  , cheney said the raging insurgency against american . troops was in its ""last throes."" nearly two years later, a commitment of more than  ,  additional american troops and a widespread effort to pay former insurgents to turn against islamic militants helped quell the worst of the violence.  ""i do not  hear much talk about that, but the fact is, the violence level is down   percent,"" cheney said. ""the number of casualties [among] iraqis and americans is significantly diminished. theres been elections, a constitution. they are  about to have another presidential election here in the near future. we have succeeded in creating in the heart of the middle east a democratically governed iraq, and that is a big deal, and it is, in fact, what we set out to do.""  but sestak said the administration was too slow to react to the problems it faced in iraq and let the conflict overshadow the ""whole fabric"" of american . national security.  ""the cost of this war is something that i strongly believe has far, far hurt us,"" he said. ""we are  going to recover, because we are  americans. but iraq was just one piece of our security, and this administration failed to realize that.""  though considered one of the administrations most influential figures, cheney said president bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues.  watch cheney tout bush administration â»  he said bush left former cheney aide lewis ""scooter"" libby ""sort of hanging in the wind"" by refusing to issue libby a pardon before leaving office. libby was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal agents investigating the leak of a former cia officers identity.  ""i believe firmly that scooter was unjustly accused and prosecuted and deserved a pardon, and the president disagreed with that,"" cheney said. he would disclose no details of his efforts to lobby the president on libbys behalf, saying they would be ""best left to history.""  and cheney said he argued against the administrations policy on north korea, which tested a nuclear weapon in  . the bush administration reached a still incomplete disarmament deal with the isolated stalinist state in   and removed it from the american . list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of the deal.  ""i had my say,"" cheney told cnn. ""i got my chance to voice my views and my objections. i did not  think the north koreans were going to keep their end of the bargain in terms of what they agreed to, and they did not .""  the obama administration has nominated christopher hill, the state department official who was the top american . negotiator with north korea, to be the american . ambassador to iraq. cheney said hill lacks the middle east experience that his predecessors have, and ""i did not support the work that chris hill did with respect to north korea.""  ""i think it is  a choice that i would not  have made,"" he said.","new  cheney  harsh interrogations, warrantless eavesdropping ""essential"". new  former vice president says bush rebuffed his advice on two big issues.

"washington  cnn     a federal judge on tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for omar gonzalez, who is accused of jumping the white house fence, after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial.  u.s. district court judge rosemary collyer expressed concern that the initial mental exam, ordered by a magistrate judge, was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it. david bos, the federal public defender representing gonzalez, objected to any examination in the first place because he says gonzalez is fit for trial.  the   minute initial mental examination of gonzalez at the district of columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense. but the result, finding gonzalez not competent, ca not  be ignored, collyer said in court tuesday.  bos told the judge  ""there is no doubt in my mind that mr. gonzalez is competent to stand trial."" nonetheless, he withdrew his objections and agreed to allow his client to undergo a fuller competency examination to try to undo the results of the initial examination.  the judge delayed arraignment for gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week.  gonzalez was arrested in september after he allegedly jumped the white house fence and sprinted into the executive mansion, setting off concerns about secret service security procedures.  he was found with a folding knife and told a secret service agent ""that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the president of the united states so that he could get the word out to the people,"" according to an agents affidavit filed in court. his family has said gonzalez, an iraq war veteran, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and paranoia.  the incident came amid a series of disclosures about secret service lapses that cost the agencys director, julia pierson, her job.  collyer said that during the initial examination, the mental health screener found gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings. the judge suggested that gonzalezs mental issues, which she did not  describe more fully, could be resolved with medication.  the judge also raised concerns that the governments handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for gonzalez to be examined at a federal bureau of prisons facility. she gave one example of an united nations amed defendant who sat at the district of columbia jail for months before anyone noticed he had not  received the tests that were ordered. the problem, she said, was that sequestration has cut resources for the bureau of prisons and finding a bed can take time.  collyer ordered the mental health screening to be done in   days and set a new hearing for december   at     a.m.","omar gonzalez is accused of jumping the white house fence in september. an initial evaluation finds him not competent to stand trial. his attorney argues gonzalez is fine, but agrees to more thorough exam.

" cnn     criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing peoples identities could rake in an estimated    billion over the next five years because the irs cannot keep up with the amount of the fraud, treasury inspector general j. russell george said tuesday.  ""our analysis found that, although the irs detects and prevents a large number of fraudulent refunds based on false income documents, there is much fraud that it does not detect,"" said georges prepared testimony before a joint hearing of the house ways and means subcommittees on oversight and social security.  georges report is the first detailed analysis of the tax refund fraud problem, which could affect any legitimate taxpayer. his projection of    billion is larger than any other estimate of identity theft tax fraud.  in a statement issued following georges testimony, the irs said it ""believes that the five year estimate is far too high.""  ""the estimate was based on   figures, which took place before the irs instituted major changes with the way it handles identity theft cases,"" the irs statement read. ""our expanded screening on issues such as w   matching, schedule c information, interest income and social security income have had a major impact on our ability to reduce identity theft fraud.""  those efforts, according to the irs, have lead to ""stopping more refund fraud than ever before"" and ""are not reflected in the five year projection"" by the treasury inspector general.  last year, according to the treasury inspector generals office, the irs reported that of the  .  million tax returns it found to be fraudulent, about  ,  returns totaling   .  billion were related to identity theft. in its investigation, george said, auditors found another  .  million undetected tax returns with more than   .  billion in fraud.  ""the primary characteristic of these cases is that the identity thief reports false income and withholding to generate a fraudulent tax return,"" george said. ""without the falsely reported income, many of the deductions and/or credits used to inflate the fraudulent tax refund could not be claimed on the tax return. the individuals whose identities were stolen may not even be aware that their identities were used to file a fraudulent tax return.""  making the problem worse, george said, the irs is hampered by limited resources.  ""even with improved identification of these returns, the next step of verifying whether the returns are fraudulent will require resources,"" he said. ""the irs has faced budget cuts, a hiring freeze and staffing reductions during the same time it has encountered a significant surge in identity theft refund fraud. without the necessary resources, it is unlikely that the irs will be able to work the entire inventory of potentially fraudulent returns it identifies. the irs will only select those tax returns that it can verify based on its resources.""  the scope of the problem is illustrated by what george said his auditors found for tax year  , in which  ,  social security numbers were used multiple times as a primary taxpayer identification number.  ""when the identity thief files the fraudulent tax return, the irs does not yet know that the individuals identity will be used more than once,"" george said. ""as a result, the tax return is processed, and the fraudulent refund is issued. these instances result in the greatest burden to the legitimate taxpayer.""  as of last month, the irs reported that it had stopped the issuance of   .  billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns. the irs says it determined these returns were potentially fraudulent through a sampling of returns, and it does not believe any legitimate returns were included.  george said more should be done to ensure that fraudulent tax returns are not deposited into bank accounts. in addition, thieves commonly get the refunds put on debit cards.  ""direct deposits should not be made to debit cards issued by financial institutions and debit card administration companies that do not take sufficient steps to authenticate individuals' identities,"" george said.  to make matters worse, the irs is not effectively helping the victims of identity theft, george said, adding that it can take more than a year to resolve these cases.  ""the irs acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft,"" george said. ""it also has not been able to quantify the amount of improper payments resulting from identity theft.""  in an investigation into tax refund fraud, cnn reported in march that criminals have purchased luxury cars, jewelry and plastic surgery with the money.  first, thieves obtain social security numbers and other personal information from insiders at hospitals, doctors offices, car dealerships or anywhere the information is stored. then, they file an online tax return using the real taxpayers name and a fictitious income. in most cases, the criminals buy a debit card so the irs can issue the refund on that card, although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual treasury checks.  the thieves know that the irs does not verify the employer w  s sent with the return until after the refund is issued.  the irs maintains it has certain filters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud, and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem. it has also issued special personal identification numbers, or pins, to identity theft victims when they are filing future returns.  but in testimony before congress last year, national taxpayer advocate nina olson said those filters ""inevitably block large numbers of proper refund claims"" since there ""is no easy way to distinguish proper claims from improper ones.""  in testimony prepared for tuesdays hearing, deputy irs commissioner steven miller said the agency cannot stop all identity theft.  ""however, we have improved, and we are committed to continuing to improve our programs. we can and will continue to work to prevent the issuance of fraudulent refunds, and we can and will continue to work with innocent taxpayers to clear their accounts and/or get them money faster in a courteous and professional manner.""  at the same time, miller said, there is a ""delicate balance"" in the ""need to make payments in a timely manner with the need to ensure that claims are proper and taxpayer rights are protected.""  in the past four years, he said, the irs has identified more than  ,  taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft.  ""various new identity theft filters are in place to improve our ability to spot false returns before they are processed and before a refund is issued,"" miller said.  the irs has issued special identification numbers to taxpayers whose identities have been stolen and clamped down on abuses in filing returns under deceased taxpayers' identities and prisoners. the agency also started a pilot program in april to help local law enforcement in obtaining tax return information related to ongoing criminal investigations.  ""i cannot tell you that we will beat this problem in one year,"" miller said. ""i can tell you that we have committed our talents and resources to prevent the issuance of fraudulent returns and have developed processes to minimize the pain felt by those who have been victimized.""","the treasurys estimate is the first detailed analysis of the ongoing problem. with budget cuts, the irs cannot deal with the fraud, according to inspector general. irs says it stopped the issuance of   .  billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns.

""we are  putting a great deal into the search,"" he said, referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the mans voice.  in the video, foley,  , is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black, who speaks with what experts say is a distinctly english accent.  linguists said that based on his voice, the man sounds to be younger than  . he also appears to have been educated in england from a young age and to be from southern england or london.  britain close to identifying james foleys killer, ambassador says     will the united states expand air strikes to isis targets in syria   pressure is increasing on obama to go after isis in both iraq and syria, ignoring an essentially non existent border between them.  last week, defense secretary chuck hagel and joint chiefs chairman gen. martin dempsey said that taking on isis in syria was the only way to defeat the sunni jihadists.  for obama, the step would reverse his refusal for three years to get involved militarily in syria despite pressure from his own advisers, including former secretary of state hillary clinton.  obama ""has not made any decision to order military action in syria,"" white house spokesman josh earnest said monday, but the speculation and insistence continued.  ""the white house is trying to minimize the threat we face in order to justify not changing a failed strategy,"" conservative gop sen. lindsey graham of south carolina said monday.  cnn national security analyst peter bergen said it will be difficult to defeat isis without ground forces, something obama clearly opposes. intervening in syria also could result in some strange geopolitical bedfellows, he noted.  ""two of the most effective fighting forces in syria are al qaeda or al qaeda splinter groups, or groups like hezbollah, backed by iran,"" bergen said. ""so if you intervene, you may be helping iran and hezbollah and  syrian president bashar al assads  regime.""  obama already sent military advisers to iraq and launched air strikes to protect them and minority groups from isis fighters rampaging through the countrys north.  is obama heading toward airstrikes in syria   a white house spokesman said last week that obama would consult with congress before taking such a step in syria. the president also would seek to forge a coalition including regional allies as well as united nations . and european union support, officials have made clear.  republicans urge airstrikes in syria to defeat isis     will the syrian regime that obama opposes help fight isis   obama wants al assad out of power, but now the syrian leader engaged in a civil war against a american . backed opposition is offering to help him take on isis.  foreign minister walid moallem said monday his government would accept support from the united states and others working under the united nations . umbrella to fight ""terrorists""    a code word for the group that calls itself the islamic state and seeks to establish a caliphate across a sunni dominated swath of the the middle east.  moallem, however, warned against any unilateral action or strikes in syrian territory without its permission, saying ""any effort to fight terrorism should be done in coordination"" with the ""syrian government.""  last week, atlantic council senior fellow and syria expert frederic hof said a american . rescue mission for foley earlier this year that went into syria but failed to find him established the precedent for military action across the iraq border, superseding any legal considerations such as being asked by the host government to enter.  ""the sort of legal barrier that prohibited doing something inside syria now seems to have evaporated,"" hof said.  the syrian offer to help fight isis comes after al assads government enabled the group to expand amid the syrian civil war. isis fighters have attacked the syrian opposition fighting government forces, but also have seized some government territory.  al assads military recently launched its own air strikes on isis positions, amounting to what hof described as a dispute between crime gangs over money    in this case, from oil fields occupied by isis.  syria ready to cooperate with un to fight terror     will isis attack the west   to some in the united states, especially critics of obama, an isis attack on american . interests and even the homeland is a question of when, not if.  ""isis is a very powerful local organization, and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization,"" former cia chief michael hayden told cnn on sunday. ""but it is  one that has global ambitions    and it has the tools.""  theres no clear consensus inside the intelligence community as to whether isis, which calls itself the islamic state, is currently capable of striking the west.  ""it is  expressed the intent,"" hayden said. ""theres no more powerful way to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the west.""  graham, a consistent advocate for increased american . military might, told cnn on sunday that ""it is  about time now to assume the worst about these guys, rather than to be underestimating them.""  isis threat to the west     can the isis money flow be stopped   bank robbery, kidnapping, smuggling, selling oil on the black market    isis gets money to fund and expand its organization in all kinds of ways.  officials say the group can get about    million a day by selling discounted oil from fields it has seized in iraq. it also has grabbed millions robbing banks including an iraqi central bank in mosul.  western allies can reduce the groups income by refusing to pay ransom for abducted citizens and pressuring regional governments to crack down on wealthy citizens sending money to it.  the united states is working with governments in the region, including kuwait, qatar and saudi arabia, to stop such private donations, state department spokeswoman marie harf said last week.  isis oil money",white house  president obama has not decided on air strikes in syria. possible options include air strikes on isis targets in syria. some consider the group a direct threat to american . security. obama spent three years avoiding a american . military role in syria.

"ballet dancer pavel dmitrichenko, often cast as the villain in bolshoi ballet productions, is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a tchaikovsky score.  the   year old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind bolshoi artistic director sergei filin, the man who put him in the roles of ivan the terrible and swan lakes evil genius.  the mystery of who threw sulfuric acid into filins face in january has captivated russians and kept moscow detectives busy probing rivalries within russias renowned   year old ballet company.  it might well send hollywood literary agents and producers scrambling for story details as described by police reports and local media accounts.  police declared their case was solved this week with a confession by dmitrichenko  russian police question suspect in bolshoi directors acid attack  ""i organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened,"" he is heard saying in a video released by police.  the characters in this drama include dmitrichenkos girlfriend, anzhelina vorontsova. she has not been charged, but local newspapers quote ballet members as saying dmitrichenko was angry because he thought filin was stifling her career.  two alleged co conspirators have been detained  alleged hit man yuri zarutsky    a burly, bearded russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death    and andrey lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car after zarutksys battery acid attack on filin.  while the final act must still play out in a russian courtroom, the story opens in the nearly two century old bolshoi theatre.  act     the bolshoi theatre  ballet is a world where competition is fierce, and where the artistic director wields considerable influence in making or breaking careers.  filin,  , was promoted to the bolshoi theatres coveted post in march  , shortly after the deputy ballet director, gennady yanin, who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post, resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online.  there was ""fierce rivalry"" for the bolshoi position at the time, according to the ria novosti news agency.  that year, two dancers quit, unhappy with the direction the ballet had taken.  another dancer, nikolai tsiskaridze, loudly criticized filin for going over budget in the ballets multimllion dollar renovation.  tsiskaridze, incidentally, was also a contender for the artistic director job that filin got.  but beyond professional disagreements, sinister factors were also at play.  act     the streets of moscow  ria novosti reported that before the attack, filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls.  someone slashed his car tires. somebody also attempted to hack his facebook page.  the trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store, and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it, police said.  dmitrichenko, who studied filins schedule, called lipatov and zarutsky when he saw filin leave the theater on the cold night of january  , police said.  as filin entered the security code at the door of his moscow apartment, authorities say, zarutsky confronted him and tossed the sulfuric acid into his face.  it caused third degree burns and left him blinded.  act     moscow police headquarters  detectives pored over interviews with those who knew filin and had suspicions about who would harm him. other clues led them to several cell phones that dmitrichenko had registered in other peoples names, according to a police statement.  calls from those phones led investigators to lipatov, the alleged driver.  ""i did not  see what happened there,"" lipatov told them in a video released by police. ""i just took yuri there, waited for him and gave him a lift back.""  when an interrogator asked zarutsky about the crime, he allegedly said, ""i do not  want to talk about it.""  police concluded a ""hostile relationship"" stemming from dmitrichenkos professional interaction with filin was his motive.  bolshoi prima ballerinas grace under pressure  act     a moscow court  the three men faced a judge thursday, who ordered that they be kept in police custody until the investigation is over.  if convicted, the attackers could face up to eight years in jail for willfully inflicting damage on the health of another.  it may take at least six months for filin to recover from the burns.  in the meantime, galina stepanenko, a former principal dancer, will run the company.  she says shes going to follow filins plans and she believes the dancers will now be united by greater respect and care for each other.  doctors performed a skin graft on filin and, after a second eye surgery, they were able to save his sight.  his colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision is not  lost.  read the latest news on cnn.com","judge orders all three men to be held in police custody.

"this week the supreme court heard two historic cases on marriage. even though i was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days, i ca not  predict which way the court will come down. but the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization.  hollingsworth v. perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the  th amendment of the american . constitution. united states v. windsor asks whether section   of the defense of marriage act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. doma passed in   with    of the american . house and    of the senate and was signed by president bill clinton.  the whole nation is focused on the litigation. ironically, it is  possible that neither case will be decided on the merits.  in hollingsworth, californias governor and attorney general abdicated their duties by refusing to defend their state constitution. so pursuant to california law, the sponsors of prop   â officially registered with the state â stepped in to defend the law, represented by charles cooper at cooper kirk and the alliance defending freedom.  in windsor, the defendant was the federal government. but president barack obama declared that he believes doma is unconstitutional and ordered his justice department not to defend it. so per its rules, the american . house voted to authorize paul clement  â probably the greatest supreme court lawyer practicing today â to defend doma.  article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts. one requirement is that there must be adversity between the parties. since the defendants in both cases refused to defend their own laws, the court will consider whether the constitution allows these third party legal teams to become a proper party to the lawsuits.  theres a second issue in windsor. edith windsor entered into a gay marriage in canada in   and lived in new york. when her partner died in  , windsor sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid, claiming a spousal exemption.  but new york did not create gay marriage until  , so windsor was not harmed by doma not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage, since if the irs used state definitions windsor would still be regarded an a single woman. thus it is  possible she lacks standing to sue over the issue. it also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages, which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide.  the swing vote regarding the article iii issues in both cases is probably chief justice john roberts. he openly expressed skepticism in hollingsworth and led the court in an hour long debate in windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction.  assuming the court does decide the merits, the implications are historic.  windsor would alter americas system of federalism. only the states determine who can get married. but the federal government is free to decide whom to confer federal benefits on â largely economic entitlements and federal issues such as immigration. federalism is a two way street. but if doma section   is invalidated, the states will be able to dictate whom the recipients of federal benefits are.  if windsor is historic, hollingsworth is earth shattering. if the supreme court declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one man, one woman, then all traditional marriage laws in all   states will be invalid, and there will be a serious debate  already in a lower federal court  of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition.  on the merits, the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage, though arguments did not go as well for doma. justice anthony kennedy is likely the swing vote in both.  as justice samuel alito said this week, the internet and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage. it is an energetic debate in all   states, and this summer we will learn whether the supreme court will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the american people are not allowed to vote.","ken klukowski  cases heard by supreme court could result in momentous change. he says there are questions of whether cases could be tossed because of special circumstances. if court issues sweeping ruling, it could deprive voters of chance to weigh in. klukowski  gay marriage is such a new phenomenon that court should not  freeze the debate.

"zango town, liberia  cnn     at the gravesite in a northern liberia village, there are no religious or traditional burial rites. no ceremony, no mourning, no family members, and no final goodbyes.  nothing but a group of men dressed in space suit like outfits, cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave, they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased.  these men are part of the countrys ebola response team, specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the ebola virus.  the virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with ebola, and it is still transferable even from a dead body.  to help combat the spread of the disease, the liberian government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of, or is suspected of having been infected with, ebola.  for months liberians ignored the directive, fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of ebola, but here in lofa county    ground zero of the countrys outbreak    almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus.  now almost anytime there is a suspected ebola death in the community, they call in the ebola response team to come and bury the body safely.  safe burials  ""when it started, it was not  that easy,"" says alpha tamba, an ebola response coordinator in lofa county. ""it was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death. people preferred driving us away.""  ""we must be grateful for the communities, through the efforts of the local leaders. now they are disclosing death to us,"" he explains.  today, the team has been called to a village where a woman has died of unknown causes. it may not have been from the deadly virus, but the villagers are not taking any chances.  the lofa county health team arrives carrying gloves, gowns, goggles and diluted bleach. they suit up  from head to toe, no skin is exposed. on their hands they wear three layers of gloves, securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists.  before they enter the house to collect the body, one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach. then    and only then    can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag, ready for burial.  wailing rents the air as the burial team walks out of the house carrying the body on a stretcher. some of those crying are the dead womans family members; for their own safety, they can only mourn from a distance.  town abandoned  a few kilometres away from the village is zango town  most of the houses here have been abandoned, their doors padlocked and windows shuttered.  some of the residents abandoned the town in such a hurry that their clothes and floor mats have been left hanging on clotheslines.  kazalee johnson, a community worker, tells cnn the empty houses belong to people who either died of ebola or those who fled in terror, for fear of contracting the virus.  johnson says he lost his   months pregnant sister, his brother, niece and many, many others  too many to name.  ""they died. they died,"" he says. ""so many people die    the houses on your right and even the houses on your left. they are all gone,"" says johnson.  it is  hard to imagine another area in lofa county that has been harder hit than this one.  but then theres barkedu town    of the  ,  or so ebola related deaths in liberia,    of the victims have died in this single town.  quarantine zone  home to more than  ,  people, barkedu is now under quarantine  no one can go in, and no one can go out.  the toll of the isolation is weighing heavily on the community.  ""from the time we started receiving death from ebola    every activity cease,"" says musa sessay, the towns chief. ""because we do farm here and now theres been no farming.""  ""we need food, we really need medicine. but the most important one is medicine because the hospital is closed down, there is no health worker,"" he says.  this is what life is like across lofa  the people are locked in, afraid and alone.  and not even the health workers are spared the ravaging effects of ebola.  sometimes when they are called in to investigate a case, they get there only to discover the victim is one of their own.  ebola nightmares  one of the local clinics had to be locked up after all the healthcare workers based there contracted the virus. only one survived.  ""it is very heartbreaking. you are working for the team at the front and you see them lying down. day by day, they are dying,"" says tamba, who admits the harrowing work he does has caused him nightmares.  ""sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but ebola, ebola, ebola    nothing else,"" he explains. ""several times i dream i become infected, i see myself in the case management center.""  but he says that amid all the bad news, he is beginning to hear happier tidings  an increasing number of ebola survivors, people who initially tested positive for the virus but    because they reported it early and because of the medical teams' efforts    later recovered.  these positive outcomes keep tamba hopeful as he and other health workers continue to tirelessly explain to the community how to prevent infection.  ""it is difficult to stand in front of ebola, but this is the situation we have,"" he says. ""we must do everything we can to kick ebola out of our country.

""if you are  going to follow some of the test results then you have to think that mercedes and williams have got an advantage at the beginning,"" he said. ""how long it will take for other teams to catch up, who knows   ""i would have  thought after the fourth, fifth race, you might see things settle down. someone could make a modification and gain one second, two seconds per lap. that is a massive amount. so until things settle down i would not  want to back anybody.""  the climax of the   season is set to be a dramatic one, with double points set to be awarded to the driver who takes the checkered flag at novembers abu dhabi grand prix, with the winner of that race awarded   points, rather than the usual  .  it is  a move that scheckter thinks will see the fight for the world championship go down to the wire.  ""what they are trying to do is make it so the last race determines the championship,"" he said.

""to release new information regarding the trayvon martin shooting death investigation."" many suspect that the announcement that zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutors hand.  by all accounts though, angela corey is a seasoned career prosecutor who does not  bend to public opinion or political pressure. during her   years as an assistant state attorney, corey tried hundreds of cases, including more than   homicides. during her three year plus as state attorney of the  th judicial circuit, jacksonvilles duval county jail has seen an increase in the population, despite a drop in crime in the city. some say this is a direct result of her aggressive prosecutorial bent.  but her career has not  been without controversy. recently she came under intense fire for charging   year old cristian fernandez as an adult in the killing of his   year old brother, making christian the youngest person in florida ever to be charged as an adult.  corey, a devout episcopalian, references her faith in discussing her cases, which some would say is a no no for a prosecutor. in a written statement she provided in response to her detractors about the fernandez case, corey defended her decision to charge fernandez as an adult by stating, ""we are blessed in the  th circuit to have a great working relationship with ... public defenders,"" and ""we asked for prayers for our two year old victim, david, and for cristian fernandez.""  in discussing the investigation into the shooting death of martin she said, ""what we are asking people to do is take a step back. pray for trayvon. pray for his family. listen to their words. i believe these are wonderful people who are asking for a peaceful approach to this case, while still demanding the answers they deserve. and i look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey. our victims always have a tough plight.""  if she files charges against zimmerman, it would be wise not to ""overcharge"" the case. corey needs to be able to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt. to prove manslaughter in florida, coreys team would have to prove that zimmermans acts caused martins death. manslaughter would not be difficult to prove but for floridas ""stand your ground"" law.  floridas law states that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force ... to prevent death or great bodily harm.  so even if zimmerman killed martin, he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm. it seems the sanford police certainly believed zimmermans claims. but there is an exception.  if zimmerman was the initial aggressor, he cannot avail himself of the protection of the ""stand your ground"" law. former florida state rep. dennis baxley, the co sponsor of the law, told me by phone that the law does not  apply to zimmerman if he pursued martin and was the initial aggressor. and he is right.  floridas statute makes it clear that the justification is not available to a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself, unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape.  and that is what this case ultimately boils down to    who started the fight. and the answer to that question is far from clear.  martin left the home of his fathers fiancee on february   to buy skittles and an ice tea. he was unarmed. zimmerman left his home to go to target and was carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit. martin was   years old, zimmerman,  . the police report describes martin as   feet tall and   pounds and lists zimmerman as   foot  .  zimmerman sees martin, deems him ""suspicious"" and calls the police. zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following martin. the dispatcher tells zimmerman ""we do not  need you to do that."" martin notices zimmerman is following him and tells his girlfriend, dee dee, with whom he is on the phone. she tells him to run, and he agrees to walk quickly.  zimmerman says that he returns to his parked suv and is attacked suddenly by martin. dee dee hears someone ask martin why he is there. martin asks zimmerman why he is following him. dee dee believes she hears martin being tackled. witnesses say they heard angry words, heard someone crying for help  many explain it sounded like the voice of a younger person  and then a single gunshot. the screams for help stop.  three witnesses saw zimmerman straddling martin in the grass. the incident happens   yards from the home martin was walking to, not near zimmermans suv. martin is found dead, laying on his stomach. zimmerman is bleeding from his nose and the back of his head and has stains on the back of his jacket. zimmerman is not  tested for drug or alcohol consumption and is allowed to leave the police station with the clothes he was wearing that night.  a tenet of our legal system is that when there is conflicting evidence, let a jury decide. i believe in our jury system. let them decide.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sunny hostin.","sunny hostin  the state attorney has made it clear that she alone will decide on charges. she says the public withdrawal by lawyers representing george zimmerman was strange. hostin  zimmermans actions may not have been covered by the ""stand your ground"" law. she says she believes in the jury system; it makes sense to let a jury decide.

" cnn     rip it up and start again.  as a   year old, ana ivanovic claimed the french open on roland garros' clay courts. all the portents suggested great things were ahead of the serbian.  here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve, with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable.  but six years on, much like the characters vladimir and estragon in samuel becketts play ""waiting for godot""    a drama about the passing of time    the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending.  since that win in paris in  , ivanovic has suffered from big match nerves, serving woes and a series of injury problems.  it is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis, chopping and changing coaching teams along the way.  her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language.  ""i have  been working really hard,"" ivanovic told retired grand slam champion kim clijsters in an interview for cnns open court show. ""i have a new team with me since wimbledon and it is  a serbian team for me for the first time.""  ivanovics new team includes coach and hitting partner nemanja kontic    who represented montenegro in the davis cup    fitness coach zlatko novkovic and physio branko penic.  they have all been part of her entourage since her split with british coach nigel sears in july, following a second round exit at wimbledon.  her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams.  since parting company with her early mentor zoltan kuharsky in  , she has employed david taylor, craig kardon, heinz gunthardt, antonio van grichen and sears. a number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the adidas player development program.  it is  not just coaches that have come and gone. it is  also true of fitness trainers.  such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut, desperately searching for a way out of it.  her desire to follow up that   french open win has also led ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place    for the enjoyment.  ""we are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting, because the year gets very long,"" she said of her team.  in kontic, ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with sears, yet the   year old, ranked  , th in mens doubles, is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy    a shared cultural identity.  ""i am  really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you,"" ivanovic said.  employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to ivanovic performing consistently, according to a former grand slam champion turned coach.  ""shes hooked up with someone she has trust in and shes finding herself,"" jo durie, who won mixed doubles at the australian open and wimbledon, told cnn.  ""it is  about confidence with ana. her sense of trust in herself is what she needs.  ""a lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, i can never understand that. you need to get to know someone.""  ivanovics solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world no.  , for   weeks in total.  now ranked  th, she has been outside of the top   since june  , partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that   win over dinara safina in paris.  wrist, shoulder, foot, abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as ivanovic fell to no.   in the rankings. although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the wta tour calendar, parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players.  ""especially at the end of the year when from america we mostly go back to europe for a week and then we go to asia for quite a few weeks, so thats kind of tiring and hard,"" she said.  ""i know it is  difficult to fit it all around it, but asia at the end of the year really gets a lot of players.""  while her playing fortunes might have fluctuated, ivanovics marketability has never been dented.  according to forbes, she was the ninth highest paid female athlete in   with total earnings of    million    brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including adidas, yonex, juice plux and dubai duty free.  ivanovic has had a number of high profile boyfriends    including masters winning golfer adam scott and fellow tennis player fernando verdasco    but as caroline wozniacki has discovered, it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship.  her latest campaign, though, does not look like being clouded by such distraction or, just as importantly, injury.  kicking off the   season in auckland, new zealand, she ground out a victory against fellow former no.   venus williams to end a more than two year title drought. it was the ideal preparation for next weeks australian open.  despite ivanovics obvious talent, durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam.  ""i think she will  find it difficult,"" added durie. ""she can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches.  ""shes capable of big wins, she can certainly beat players like serena williams. but can she beat petra kvitova and serena in a row ""  clijsters retired for a second time in  , having won four grand slams, as she decided to focus on her family    and has since had a second child.  ivanovic, now  , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis.  ""i still feel like there is so much i can achieve and so many tournaments i can win,"" she told the belgian.  ""i do not  want to put a date to it because i think you feel it when the time is right. family is a big part of my life and i want to have lots of kids of my own one day.  ""tennis is a big part of my life, but it is  not my whole life. so definitely i want to achieve what i can on the court and then focus.""",ana ivanovic has a new all serbian team behind her for the first time. the   year old has parted company with a number of coaches in the past. the serbians last grand slam success came at the french open in  . she is feeling confident about new season after finishing   ranked  th. 
"new york  cnn     a federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of new york city firefighters.  u.s. district judge nicholas garaufis said the city needs ""to comprehensively reassess its policies and practices, to analyze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices, and to rationally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is    in actual practice and effect    fair and open to all.""  the order requires the city to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next   years to make sure those steps are taken.  garaufis cited ""the clear evidence of disparate impact that mayor  michael  bloomberg and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked.""  ""instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the citys abysmal track record of hiring black and hispanic firefighters, the bloomberg administration dug in and fought back,"" the judge said in his ruling.  mark lavorgna, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city intends to appeal the decision.  litigation against the citys firefighter hiring practices began in  , when the american . department of justice filed a complaint alleging the fire department of new yorks hiring exams negatively affected black and hispanic applicants.

" cnn     american journalist james foley was murdered, beheaded by an english speaking member of isis, the extremist group that calls itself the islamic state and has already conquered large swaths of two middle eastern countries. the sickening execution, recorded and released online for the world to see, came with a warning to the american .  isis showed another captive american journalist, believed to be steven sotloff, and threatened to kill him too if the american . does not stop helping those fighting to stop isis advances.  the killing and the threat, along with all the evidence isis is leaving as it gouges its way across the region, are a direct challenge to the american people, to the american . government and to the international community.  as it makes increasingly clear what kind of an organization it is, isis is sending a message  ""stay out of this, so we can keep driving toward our objective.""  president obama said wednesday that ""we will do everything we can to protect our people ... the entire world is appalled by the brutal murder.""  the american . government has crucial steps to take now. first, obviously, it cannot give into isis threats and must continue helping dislodge isis from northern iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against christians and other minorities; kidnapping, raping and selling women; and massacring people. the american . effort should keep a special focus on helping americas loyal and ideologically moderate friends, the kurds of iraq.  at the same time, the american . should make a strong diplomatic push to obtain international legitimacy for the campaign to defeat isis. it is important to prevent isis from scoring a recruiting victory among muslims and anti western and anti american camps by portraying this as a war between islam and the west, which it is not.  there are few people on earth who are not horrified by isis. that includes the overwhelming majority of muslims. the grand mufti of saudi arabia, abdul aziz al sheikh, called isis and al qaeda ""enemy no.  "" of islam. countless muslims have criticized and condemned them.  isis is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to isis. they kill minorities, shiite muslims and sunnis who do not  abide by their views. they are virulently opposed to the west, to the american ., to modernity and to anyone who sees the world differently from their narrow medieval perspective.  the american . should seek a united nations . resolution declaring that the international community, including the muslim world, considers isis and its methods repugnant. any country that disagrees, any government that is not revolted by isis and troubled by its methods and its goals, should go on record saying so.  before isis, we knew that human beings are capable of american peakable brutality. but anyone who thought mans inhumanity to man had eased after the mass crimes of the  th century now knows better. isis did not  just remind us how cruel humans can be; it has taken the use of brutality as a weapon of intimidation, extermination, genocide and recruitment propaganda to new levels.  isis is not the first to murder victims in large numbers; it is not the first to kill those who disagree with its beliefs or who belong to different ethnic or religious groups. but it seems no group has advertised its bloodlust with such relish and effectiveness.  more important, those using these methods, embracing this philosophy, are in control of enormous territories. when isis calls itself a state, it is not hyperbole by very much. isis has taken over a a tract of land bigger than many countries, something that al qaeda, its comparatively mild mannered inspiration, never came close to achieving.  isis has established and gained full dominion not only of cities and populations but of wealthy oil producing lands. it is now financially self sufficient, collecting millions of dollars every day from oil smuggling operations. if not stopped, it could continue its push toward the oil fields of southern iraq at the edge of the persian gulf, which remains the epicenter of oil and gas production that allows the global economy to function.  if osama bin laden were not  dead, he would die of envy.  isis views the videos of mass executions, of severed heads on poles and of crucified men, as a way to keep its enemies frightened and weakened, and a way to tell prospective recruits that it is fearless in its war to create an islamic caliphate ruling over all the worlds muslims. its leader, abu bakr al baghdadi, incidentally, claims to rule over all muslims and believes the ultimate goal of isis is to take over huge sections of asia, europe and africa.  the killing of foley, an idealistic journalist, sharpens our understanding of the organization seeking to dominate the middle east. that the man who murdered him might have been british should erase any remaining fantasy in the west that this gruesome war, now raging in syria and iraq, will stay within any countrys or any regions borders.  those who seek to downplay the risk to the united states should think again.  britain has confirmed that foleys killer was most likely a british citizen. there have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of europeans training, fighting and killing alongside isis.  in june  , a video from syria surfaced, showing men cutting off another mans head. to the shock of europeans, they were heard speaking dutch.  the isis members who hold european passports are able to travel freely across europe and the american . and are prepared to do the unthinkable. there are hundreds of germans, spaniards, belgians, french. graduates of the syria war, from where isis pushed into iraq, have killed in europe.  and isis ideology is gaining support in the continent. last month, isis flags flew in an anti israel demonstration in the hague, chanting against america and the west and most enthusiastically, ""death to the jews.""  isis can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the middle east. if it does, the consequences will become even more catastrophic. in iraq alone,  .  million people have been displaced, thousands killed.  it is politically and strategically complicated, because isis is also fighting syrian president bashar al assad and hezbollah, and defeating isis would also be enormously pleasing to iran. but the group is a growing threat.  the strategy of supporting the kurds and the iraqis in the front lines is a good one. it must be bolstered with material and diplomatic support. if it proves insufficient to turning back the bloody isis tide, then it must be revamped.  foleys mother said her son gave his life trying to expose to the world the suffering of the syrian people. that suffering has now extended to iraq, and it will only become more widespread if isis is not stopped.","frida ghitis  american . cannot give in to isis threats, must focus on helping kurds of iraq. ghitis  united nations . resolution should declare that muslims, rest of the world find isis horrific. ghitis  american . should make sure this is not framed as a war against islam and the west. she says isis is a threat to the whole world; europeans are joining in big numbers.

""at my school, we will  learn,"" she says, brushing her hands longingly over the slide. ""teachers will show up and we will  be allowed to ask questions. we will  be allowed to draw with color.""  such aspirations, however, amount to fantasy for most youth in a country still struggling to land on its feet after being turned completely american ide down.  two and a half years after the countrys uprising began, egypts fledgling democracy is stillborn, stubbornly stuck between its past and future. and as the government struggles to wade through the countrys protracted political problems, egypts festering education system is orphaned    even though, with a growing youth population, it is  key to the countrys future.  in the world economic forums latest report on global competitiveness, egypt ranked near the bottom     st out of   countries    for quality of primary education. egypts literacy rate is   , according to a   united nations report. meanwhile, a report by london think tank chatham house says just    a year is spent on each egyptian student; the united states, for example, spends   times as much.  the situation is worst in regions far from the capital, and in upper egypt, where more than half the population is under  .  many schools look more like rank penitentiaries rather than hubs of learning. students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration.  and forget technology. desks and a stable electricity supply are luxuries.  ""we did not  have enough desks last year,"" recalls asmaas   year old neighbor, omnia. ""so most of us just sat on the floor. we only get a little paper, but my mom found this,"" she said, holding up a small, faded ""hannah montana"" notebook. the american pop culture reference is lost on her.  to make up for the gaps in education, millions of middle class egyptian families spend a large part of their income    sometimes as much as       on private tutoring. it is  impossible to know how much money is spent in all, but some estimates put the total at    billion a year.  public school teachers rarely make more than    a month. more than a few of them say they teach the bare minimum in class so that they can earn more from the same students in private tutoring sessions.  ""there are too many issues to deal with,"" said one   year old teacher in asmaas village.

" cnn     activists speaking at a syrian government sponsored ""national dialogue"" meeting sunday criticized recent crackdowns by the countrys security forces, calling for an end to violence against protesters.  syrias vice president hailed the damascus university meeting between officials and members of the opposition as a step toward creating a ""democratic nation.""  ""we hope that at the end of this comprehensive meeting to announce the transition of syria to a pluralistic democratic nation where all citizens are guided by equality and participate in the modeling of the future of their country,"" vice president faruq al shara said in opening remarks at the meeting, which was broadcast live on state television.  syrian activists say that security personnel have assaulted unarmed protesters during months of anti government demonstrations that erupted nationwide in mid march. the syrian government has claimed armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations.  several speakers at sundays meeting called on syrias government to change its tactics.  ""the bloodshed needs to stop. yes, there are unauthorized protests, but is it a reason to use unjustified and excessive violence  the use of all types of excessive force is unjustified,"" said qadri jameel of the opposition front of change and liberation.  syrian researcher al tayyeb tizzina also criticized the use of force and asked for violence to stop in order for the dialogue to succeed.  ""the establishment of a political society requires the immediate start of a process dismantling the police state that is dominating syria,"" he said.  al shara acknowledged that a surge of violence in syria precipitated sundays meeting.  ""we have to admit that without the big sacrifices that were presented by the syrian people, from the blood of their sons, civilians or military in more than one province, city and town, this meeting would not  have happened,"" he said.  the state run syrian arab news agency said the meeting included members of the opposition, independent activists, youth leaders and academics.  however, some opponents of president bashar al assads regime have criticized the meeting, saying the government is trying to quiet widespread unrest without making meaningful changes.  demonstrators protested the meeting in nationwide ""no dialogue"" marches friday.  ""any dialogue must be based on the base of  al assads  stepping down from power,"" said a statement from the change in syria conference, an opposition group that called for al assad to hand over power to the vice president at a meeting in turkey last month.  sundays dialogue meeting began as syrias foreign ministry summoned the american . and french ambassadors and accused them of interfering in internal affairs when they visited syrias fourth largest city without permission last week, state media reported.  the ministry told the diplomats that their visit to the city of hama violated the vienna convention, according to sana. that   accord, brokered through the united nations, sets ground rules as to how diplomats can operate in other countries.  however, a senior american . state department official said american . ambassador robert ford was not summoned by syrian officials on sunday; his meeting with syrias foreign minister was previously scheduled by the american . embassy in damascus last thursday. the official declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation.  in the meeting, ford said his visit to hama was meant to gather information and support freedom of expression. he also accused the syrian government of inciting syrians against the united states, including organizing a protest outside the american . embassy friday and saturday, the senior state department official said.  protesters threw tomatoes, eggs, glass and rocks at the embassy as they called for the ambassador to leave during the   hour demonstration, according to the senior state department official, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation.  state department spokeswoman victoria nuland issued a blunt rebuttal to similar syrian government accusations friday, calling claims that fords visit was inciting protesters ""absolute rubbish"" and saying she was ""dismayed"" by the syrian governments reaction. nuland said the american . embassy had notified the syrian defense ministry before the visit and that fords car was waved through a security checkpoint.  the french foreign ministry issued a statement sunday saying that its embassy had also been besieged by demonstrators, faulting syrian authorities for failing to stop the destruction of vehicles, burning of french flags and other damage.  the french government summoned syrias ambassador to france on sunday to issue a formal protest on this matter, and to hold syrian authorities responsible for the security of french diplomats in the middle eastern country. it also challenged the damascus governments decision to summon eric chevallier, frances own ambassador to syria.  like the american . ambassador, chevallier visited hama on thursday and spent the night, the french government said, meeting with wounded people and their families and medical staffers at a hospital.  al assad issued a decree appointing a hama provincial governor sunday, a day after firing the existing leader after a series of peaceful demonstrations there, including a massive anti government protest last friday.  activists and human rights watch have reported many arrests and deaths in a fierce government crackdown in the area. citizens have called a general strike in the city.  diplomatic tensions over syria also flared in washington last week, with the state department summoning syrian ambassador imad mustapha friday.  the state department said mustapha was called ""to express a number of our concerns with the reported actions of certain syrian embassy staff in the united states.""  the statement, issued in response to a question taken at fridays daily briefing, said the state department had received reports that syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the united states.

" cnn     half a century ago, with the space race in full swing, the heated quest for interplanetary exploration between the earths superpowers gained a new, self proclaimed, contender.  ""we are  going to mars "" audaciously declared zambian schoolteacher edward makuka nkoloso in a   newspaper op ed, revealing to the world his fanciful plans for his country to beat the united states and the soviet union in their fierce battle to conquer outer space.  ""our rocket crew is ready,"" continued nkoloso, explaining that his aspiring troupe of space explorers had been gearing up for their interstellar journey in the headquarters of the academy he would  set up on the outskirts of zambian capital lusaka.  from within what he called the ""academy of sciences and space technology,"" nkoloso said, he would  been studying mars through telescopes. he would  also been training his would be astronauts by rolling them down a hill in oil drums, a technique aimed at getting his team acclimatized to the weightlessness experienced during space travel.  read this  nigerian doctor takes to the skies  ""specially trained spacegirl matha mwambwa, two cats  also specially trained  and a missionary will be launched in our first rocket,"" wrote nkoloso, a grade school science teacher and self appointed director of the space academy.  unsurprisingly, the program, which was never taken seriously by the government of the newly independent zambia, failed to take off; a    million grant nkoloso said he would  requested from unesco never came, whilst the pregnancy of the   year old spacegirl brought the proceedings to an end.  ""the afronauts""  fast forward to  , when spanish photographer cristina de middel was searching for ""unbelievable stories"" for a new personal project she was hoping to develop.  whilst scouring the depths of the internet, she stumbled on a website listing the   craziest experiments in history.  ""the first one on the list was the zambia space program,"" says de middel who, after a decade of working as a news photojournalist, had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller.  fascinated by nkolosos visionary and dreamy perspective on life, de middel set about creating an imaginary documentation of his elusive endeavors some   years ago.  the result is ""the afronauts,"" an arresting photo book that has been shortlisted for this years esteemed deutsche bã¶rse photography prize.  in the self published book, de middel self consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece. she uses a series of cinematographic images, including staged depictions of discarded oil barrels, makeshift spaceships, elephant hugging spacemen and flying cats, as well as vintage looking maps, documents and newspapers cuttings.  throughout, facts and fiction are intertwined as part of an intriguing narrative which challenges viewers' perceptions about what is  real and what is  not.  ""i was working in a very free way,"" says de middel, sitting at the cafã© of the photographers gallery in london, where the afronauts is being exhibited.  ""i needed to add mystery; i needed to add this fascination for great things and work on the photographic language that would not state if it is  true,"" adds de middel, encouraging viewers to question the documentary value of photography. ""otherwise, i would have ruined the game.""  ""big dreams""  whilst playful, de middels dream like images are not intended to make fun of nkolosos fantastical, yet high flying, ambitions.  her speculative pictures exude a feeling of nostalgia and sympathy, celebrating the audacious and naive spirit of a past era where grandiose dreams were not limited by circumstances.  ""i think thats the greatest characteristic we have as humans, that we can dream of becoming big,"" says de middel.  read this  artists spectacular glasses  ""that is something common to all humanity,"" she adds. ""you do not  have to be american and work for nasa to dream of going to the moon; you can be an african    he [nkoloso] was a school teacher and thought that could be done.""  ""honest approach""  creating the afronauts, which was sold out in just a few months, de middel worked more as a movie director, trying to make the best of the resources around her. for models, she relied on social media and friends; for the astronauts' helmets, she used old domes of street lights; and for the flashy spacesuits, she employed the sewing talents of her grandmother.  ""it was like a short, small and very modest movie production,"" says de middel. ""but instead of producing a moving image, i just did stills.""  most of the images were shot in between different projects, in locations such as spain, the palestinian territories, italy and romania. others were repurposed pictures from the photographers archive.  de middel, whos never been to zambia, acknowledges shes not ""an expert in africa""    nor in space. this led her to go about the story with caution.  ""i always kept in my mind that i do not  know a lot about african history and i am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people,"" says de middel.  so far, she says, her work has received a great response from people in africa. shes been contacted by nigerias space program and been invited to the continent to give talks, while her book is being shown in south africa and senegal.  ""i would love to [take the exhibition to lusaka as well],"" she says.  if anything, de middel says, the extraordinary tale of the forgotten zambian space program presented a chance to talk about africa from a different perspective.  ""the only honest approach i could do to that story was documenting my clichã©, and thats what i really wanted to do, because, in a way, i was raising awareness of the existence of that clichã© and what we expect from africa,"" she says.  read this  zambias amazing street acrobats  ""not only because the story is positive, in terms of african people having dreams, but also evidencing what we expect from africa in terms of aesthetics and behavior.""  today, nobody seems to know what happened to nkoloso or his cast of wannabe space explorers. yet nkolosos desire to dream the impossible has found a new, alternative, home inside de middels images, striking a chord with captivated audiences around the world.  ""he had a fascination for the universe that we all share,"" says de middel. ""asking if we are  alone, looking at the stars, making metaphysical questions. that is a universal feeling and it does not  belong to the people who can actually have the technology to go to the moon; it is  everywhere.""","in the mid  s, a zambian school teacher wanted to send the first african to space.

" cnn     by now, we are  on the same page that mitt romneys pick of paul ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy    run to the conservative  or liberal  base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election.  ryan may be many things    energetic, charismatic and geeky    but no one familiar with his full monty conservative budgets would describe his selection as remotely moving to the center. just the opposite    romney has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle.  what gives  did the looming prospect of defeat push romney into a desperate gamble   give romney some credit. hes made a shrewd move.  the ryan choice adopts a strategy premised on supermobilizing the base and luring a smidgeon of others. put on your thinking caps and grab an abacus, here are the numbers that could put romney in the white house.  conservatives outnumber liberals   to       to    .  rage against obama has the gop ready to walk over red hot coals to cast a ballot. a mainstay of gallups measure for determining who is likely to vote    whether survey respondents are thinking a lot about the election    shows not only that republicans are more attentive than democrats by   points but also more fired up than in recent presidential elections.  to make sure they harvest the ryan enthusiasts, the romney campaign appears to be assembling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the obama team for the early vote.  what makes the romney mobilization particularly threatening to obama is that it targets his biggest challenge    polls consistently show him ahead but there are ominous signs that a decisive group of those supporters wo not  actually cast a ballot.  even with obamas pro immigration shift and the growing number of latinos in competitive states, their actual turnout may flag from their record numbers in  . less than half of hispanics eligible to vote are registering and only    of hispanics say they will definitely vote as compared to their    response in   and the national average of    today.  ditto on youth. the percentage of voters   to   who say they will definitely vote in november      is currently running   points or more behind the national average today      or the youth turnout in        or       .  blue collar voters    never drawn to obama  think hillary clinton in   democratic primaries     may desert him in numbers that approach the ""reagan democrat"" defections in  . this possible weakness in the democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among obamas   supporters      than among mccain voters who wo not  vote gop in november     .  bottom line  by picking the bona fide conservative ryan, the republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response, which may allow romney to succeed in exploiting obamas greatest weakness at this point.  before you conclude this is far fetched, think back to karl roves strategy in   to move right with strident social conservatism on abortion and same sex marriage, steep tax cuts and hawkish policies in afghanistan and iraq. embracing the base and scorning the rush to the middle cost george w. bush the independent vote. but bush also supercharged conservatives and republicans, who turned out in droves. refuting the conventional wisdom that democrats do best in high turnout elections, it was bush who most benefited from the    jump in the total vote.  but    theres always a but.  even as ryan fires up conservatives, he may also mobilize votes for obama    including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like florida. alarmed by his draconian proposals to remake medicare, they may boost their support of obama.  another potential risk  a good number of voters may be primed to punish the incumbent for poor economic times. pluralities of ohio and florida independents report that obamas re election would hurt their personal financial situation. but the coming hullabaloo over ryans budget proposals may distract the economically pained from punishing obama.  all in all, romney has a tough battle ahead    even stringent counts of electoral college votes based on polls show obama within striking distance of winning. but using ryan to ignite the republican base is probably romneys most plausible path to prevailing. and, it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates, service records and the other side issues of recent elections. strap in, folks,   may be much more interesting and close than we would  imagined.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lawrence r. jacobs.","lawrence jacobs  mitt romney was shrewd in picking paul ryan as his running mate. jacobs  ryan can supercharge conservatives, who outnumber liberals   to  . he says

" cnn     an argument before the supreme court on october   inâ kiobel v. royal dutch petroleumâ will have enormous significance. the case concerns the torture of ogoni leaders in nigeria, but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought, the alien tort statute.  the united states stands at a crossroads. at its best, our nation has played a crucial role in championing human rights throughout the world and pioneering human rights law. at its worst, it has abandoned its lofty ideals in the name ofâ realpolitikâ and supported dictators and policies that were responsible for horrible abuses.  passed in  , the alien tort statute was a prescient piece of legislation. it allows foreign victims of human rights abuses in foreign nations to seek civil remedies in american . courts, and its animating idea    that people anywhere should have recourse for violations of the ""law of nations""    was the foundation of our modern understanding of human rights.  in the  s, royal dutch petroleum  shell  had extensive oil drilling operations in the niger delta in nigeria, a region long plagued with poverty, human rights violations and environmental disaster. a popular movement of the ogoni people resisting what they saw as reckless oil development in the region was violently suppressed by nigerias military dictatorship.  in the suit, the plaintiffs accuse royal dutch shell of helping the former dictatorship in the arrests on false charges and torture of   members of the ogoni tribe, who sought to peacefully disrupt shells operations because of the devastating health and environmental effects of unregulated drilling.â all the plaintiffs were themselves tortured except esther kiobel, who brought her claims on behalf of her late husband, barinem kiobel. kiobel was executed through a sham trial process in which the plaintiffs believe shell played a central role.  the supreme court court accepted kiobel v. royal dutch petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations. the justices indicated in february that they might question not just the application of the statute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it applies to any human rights violations, even by individuals, that take place outside the united states. they ordered the case to be re argued on exactly that question.  the case has been brought in the united states because of our nations historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law.  from franklin d. roosevelts four freedoms speech and the universal declaration of human rights that eleanor roosevelt tirelessly worked for, to the stirring oratory of robert jackson at the nuremberg tribunal, mid century americans gave voice and visibility to the idea that all people, everywhere, were entitled to certain fundamental rights. since  , the state department has annually produced country reports on human rights practices.  the international leadership of the past century is a long way from where we find ourselves now. our own era is defined by a different legacy  one of waterboarding and ""torture memos,"" extraordinary renditions, indefinite detention at guantã¡namo bay and targeted killings in countries with which we are not at war. ""the united states is abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights,"" jimmy carter wrote bluntly in the new york times in june.  shell oil must aid nigeria workers who were tortured, abused  on this grim and morally and legally compromised horizon, the alien tort statute is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy. in a groundbreaking case in  , the family of a   year old paraguayan, joelito filã¡rtiga, who had been tortured and killed by a henchman of gen. alfredo stroessner, brought and won a civil case against his murderer, americo peã±a irala. the young man had been tortured to death because his father opposed the government.  the ruling established that the statute could be used to hold modern torturers accountable for their actions, wherever they are committed. in the wake of the case,â filã¡rtiga v. peã±a irala, the alien tort statute developed into a new tool in human rights law. successful cases were brought against government officials, against non state actors like radovan karadå¾iä in bosnia herzegovina and against multinational corporations before the second circuit ruling in kiobel that disallowed that.  it is this legacy that is at stake in theâ kiobelâ case before the supreme court.  the immediate questions before the court on october   concern the reach of the alien tort statute and whether it will continue to be possible for people like the filã¡rtigas and the kiobels to pursue their tormentors and hold them accountable for their heinous acts, and whether corporations can be held to account.  but the larger question is  does the american . want to be a leader or a laggard in upholding international human rights  if the statute is narrowed and its promise of universal accountability curtailed, it will rightly be perceived as yet another step by the american . away from its once leading advocacy for human rights.  if, on the other hand, the supreme court upholds the alien tort statute, it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of vincent warren.","vince warren  at its best, american . has been key in championing universal human rights. warren  a longstanding law lets foreign victims of human rights abuse find justice in american . courts. supreme court to rule in international human rights case whether law will stand, he says. warren  if court upholds the law, the world will see american . still supports human rights for all.

deported"" to mexico to join the other six.  then, on july  , all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the united states. the idea was to draw attention to the administrations repressive immigration policies. the nine asked for humanitarian parole. when that was denied, they claimed asylum.  opinion  lets deport rep. steve king  now, they have been set free. earlier in the week, federal officials found that all nine have ""credible fear"" of persecution or torture in their birth countries and thus cannot be removed without a hearing before an immigration judge. pending those hearings, the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the united states. it is  a major victory for the dreamer movement.  for many, this is a heartwarming story about the power of the individual who is brave enough to make a stand. for others, it is major inconvenience. it is  a story that the white house wishes would go away. ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the dream   and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency.  david leopold, former president of the american immigration lawyers association, callously dismissed the dream   action as a ""publicity stunt"" and a distraction. he also said it was unlikely that the three dreamers who voluntarily left the united states would qualify for asylum.  so far, leopold has been spectacularly wrong. all nine will get asylum hearings.  and the dreamers got more warmth from congress. thirty five lawmakers signed a letter asking obama to use his discretion to release the young people from custody. the letter    signed by reps. mike honda, d california, raul grijalva, d arizona, and ruben hinojosa, d texas, among others    describes the activists as ""victims of our broken immigration policy"" who ""deserve to come home to the united states.""  immigration reformers were bound to lose confidence in this administration. a president ca not  deport nearly   million people in under five years, split up hundreds of thousands of families, detain thousands of undocumented children without giving them access to legal counsel, and expand arizona style immigration enforcement nationwide through the maniacal program known as ""secure communities"" without raising a stink.  for many, what happened to the dream   was the last straw.  searching for the american dream in mexico  martinez valdez and peniche vargas were in solitary confinement because, according to authorities, they started a ruckus in the dining hall.  of course they did. did not  obama say that the dreamers were americans except for legal status  this is how americans behave. we are  ornery, courageous and defiant. we yell ""freedom"" at the top of our lungs. these kids are americans, all right. the next thing you know, a bunch of dreamers will dump tea into boston harbor.  besides, obama made quite a show    before the election    of announcing that his administration was sparing dreamers deportation by offering deferred action and temporary work permits. nearly  ,  dreamers have been awarded the special accommodation so far.  theres not room for nine more  some might not be eligible for deferred action, some might be. lets find out.  maybe there would be more compassion on the potomac if these young people had not  embarrassed obama, put the lie to the fairy tale that this administration has been compassionate toward immigrants, divided self serving organizations such as the lawyers group aila, and pitted one group of immigration reformers against another    those who want to protect the dreamers versus those who want to protect the president.  i have  had my differences with the dreamer movement.  i think that many of these young people have a sense of entitlement, like most young people in the united states. i did not  think it was a good idea for dreamer activists to disrupt congressional hearings on immigration reform, or occupy the offices of reform advocates like rep. luis gutierrez, d illinois. and i think much of what drives dreamer activists within the united states is a look at me narcissism fed by social media and a culture where young people are told they can become the next american idol.  opinion  house, knowledge economy needs immigrants  but i never questioned their sincerity, or dismissed anything they did as a stunt. i would not  presume to tell people who put their freedom at risk along the american . mexico border that the difficult decisions they are  making are the wrong ones. and i certainly would not  do it to protect an administration that does not  deserve protecting.  the dream   are back where they belong    in the united states. but this story is not  over. the fault lines it exposed within the immigration reform movement remain.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette.","ruben navarrette  nine dreamer activists were in federal immigration detention in arizona. they would  tried to re enter the american . asking for humanitarian parole or asylum and were jailed. he says they have been freed, granted immigration hearing, drew support from congress. navarrette  dreamers sometimes have look at me activism, but this request is valid.

" cnn when photographer fabio bucciarelli first visited south sudan, he found a nation filled with hope. he found citizens worn out by decades of war    but looking forward to an independent, peaceful future.  that was two years ago, after the worlds youngest country split from its northern nemesis, sudan.  ""i remember the look on peoples faces,"" bucciarelli said. ""tired but happy, hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war.""  his return in february was anything but.  this time, bucciarelli found a nation on the brink of an abyss. instead of jubilant faces of hope, he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars.  months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead,  .  million people displaced and a looming famine, according to the united nations.  bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps, growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers.  he described the violence in south sudan as an ""invisible"" conflict.  ""it represents one of the longest and most forgotten african wars,"" he said. ""its apparent stillness leads to hear about it less and less. given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population, i find it essential to bring it to light.""  his goal, he said, is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars, provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues.  ""it is  hard to find front line war photography of the kind we have  seen in libya or syria,"" bucciarelli said. ""the images in south sudan are different. they describe visually the effect of the impending war, lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky, not clearly defined conflict.""  the latest conflict erupted in december last year, when president salva kiir accused his fired deputy, riek machar, of an attempted coup. since then, militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes.  the conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full blown war between two large tribes, the nuer and the dinka. machar belongs to the nuer community, while the president is a dinka.  bucciarellis pictures provide a rare window into a civilian population under siege.  ""south sudans war represents one of the longest and most forgotten african conflicts,"" he said. ""its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines, making these pictures even more crucial.""  social media  follow  cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography.  south sudan split from sudan in   as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in africas largest nation. that war left   million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south.  the recent clashes have been a major setback for a country so desperate for a new start.  instead of relishing its independence, residents of areas such as bentiu, bor, nyang and mingkaman are struggling to survive as communities turn against one another.  concerned neighboring nations have stepped in and urged warring parties to sign ceasefire deals, but the weapons have not gone quiet.  frantic international pleas for peace have gone unheeded.  fabio bucciarelli is an italian photographer whose work focuses on conflict and war. you can follow him on twitter.","two years ago, the worlds youngest country split from its northern nemesis, sudan. but during a recent visit, photographer fabio bucciarelli found ethnic violence raging.

""it is  pretty obvious that the perpetrator was a deeply disturbed individual,"" he said at a press conference tuesday, adding that the   year old was ""well known"" to federal and state police, as well as the australian security intelligence organization.  ""but i do not  believe he was on a terror watch list at this time.""  new south wales premier mike baird said authorities were investigating why monis    who was killed in the siege    was at large, given his criminal background.

""we need to understand why he was. we also need to understand why he was not  picked up.""  what we know, what we do not  know  accessory to murder, sex charges  the self styled muslim cleric, also known as sheikh haron, was facing dozens of charges at the time of the siege, including two counts of being an accessory to the murder of his ex wife, according to the attorney general of new south wales.  noleen hayson pal was found dead with multiple stab wounds in a stairwell, and her body had been set on fire, the sydney morning herald reported.  ""they should have put him away and thrown away the key,"" the dead womans godfather, ayyut khalik, told nbc news. he said monis used to beat pal, forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to ""outsiders.""  court documents show monis was also facing   sex related charges, including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault.  according to the sydney morning herald, the initial charges, laid in may  , related to an alleged sexual assault on a woman in western sydney in  , before other sex related charges were added regarding six additional victims.  monis was using the name mohammad hassan manteghi    his birth name, according to irans state news agency irna    and claimed to be a ""healer,"" according to the report.  monis also pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive ""poison pen"" letters to the families of australian soldiers who died in afghanistan, and was sentenced to   hours of community service. the letters were ""sadistic, wantonly cruel and deeply wounding,"" one high court judge said at the time, according to cnn affiliate seven news.  but the criminal accusations against him began even before he came to australia.  monis fled his homeland in   while being sought for allegedly committing fraud, irans semi official fars news reported.  a spokesperson at irans embassy in canberra told cnn that tehran had officially requested moniss extradition but nothing had come of it. monis had been granted political asylum in   and had had no further contact with his birth country, the spokesperson said.  who were the victims   an extremist theology  manny conditsis, a lawyer who acted for monis in relation to the accessory to murder and letter writing charges, told cnn his former client had been a cleric in shiite iran, but had become critical of the islamic republics government in the late  s, and fled to australia ""because he was going to be killed.""  he had left behind a wife and two children, who he believed monis had not seen since.  throughout the  s, said conditsis, monis ""became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of muslims and islamists around the world, and partly at least took up that cause.""  his broader cause, he said, was lobbying governments around the world, particularly australia, not to wage wars on muslim soil.  ""he was so blinded by that objective that it would seem he had lost sight of objectivity and rationality and acted in extreme ways,"" he said, describing his former client as ""intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent.""  while older footage of monis preaching shows him dressed in typical shiite clerics attire, in his social media posts, he appears to embrace a radical sunni extremist theology.  he used the internet to spread extremist beliefs, garnering nearly  ,  likes on his facebook page.  during the siege, abbott said, the hostage taker ""sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the  isis  death cult,"" abbott said.  on his website, which has now been taken down, there was a pledge of allegiance to the so called islamic state terror group.  the site describes monis as a muslim cleric and activist based in sydney who has ""continuously been under attack   false accusation by the australian government   media since he started his political letter campaign from  .""  theres a graphic photo of slain children at the top of the site. under the image, it reads, ""this is an evidence for the terrorism of america and its allies including australia. the result of their airstrikes.""  a description on the site portrayed monis as a victim of a political vendetta and compares him to julian assange, the wikileaks founder who has claimed the sex crime allegations he faces are politically motivated.  a youtube video posted in november shows monis standing on a street corner, chains draped over him, carrying a sign that says, ""i have been tortured in prison for my political letters.""  police have refused to comment on that accusation.  his last tweet linked to his website, with a haunting message posted the day of his attack on the sydney cafe  ""if we stay silent towards the criminals we cannot have a peaceful society. the more you fight with crime, the more peaceful you are.""  conditsis  told australian public broadcaster abc that monis was an isolated figure who was probably acting alone.  crisis in a cafe  mondays hostage situation began around   a.m. hundreds of police officers, including snipers, took position around the lindt chocolate cafe in sydneys central business district.  australian media captured haunting images of hostages pressing their hands against the cafes windows. they were reportedly taking turns holding a black flag with arabic writing on it that said, ""there is no god but god and mohammed is the prophet of god.""  the man holding the hostages demanded to speak to abbott. police were monitoring social media because hostages appeared to be posting information about the mans demands.  hours into the crisis, at least five hostages managed to escape, running terrified toward police in riot gear. that made the hostage taker furious, reported chris reason, a correspondent for cnn affiliate seven network. reason said he could see the gunman become ""extremely agitated"" when he realized what had happened, and he ""started screaming orders"" at the remaining hostages.  gunfire erupted early tuesday as police stormed the cafe where the gunman had been holding hostages.  two hostages were killed during the standoff. police later announced that the siege was over and that the lone gunman had been killed.","man haron monis had history of ""infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" abbott says. hostage taker was granted political asylum in australia in  ; was on bail for violent offending. his former lawyer says he campaigned against ""the victimization of muslims and islamists"". on monis' apparent website, there is a pledge of allegiance to isis.

"washington  cnn     a hearing continues thursday to determine the future of john hinckley jr., who shot president ronald reagan and three others in march  .  after an expected week and half of testimony, a federal judge will consider whether hinckley should eventually be released from a mental hospital, where he has been a patient since his   trial. the trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  on wednesday, hinckleys lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released. but prosecutors are fighting that, saying hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in williamsburg, virginia.  in opening statements, prosecutor sarah chasson said secret service agents will testify they performed surveillance on hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was american upervised free time in williamsburg.  on several occasions in july and september, hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about ronald reagan and presidential assassins, chasson said. a requirement of hinckleys current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the secret service are informed.  according to chasson, in the first instance in july, hinckley was supposed to go to the movie ""captain america."" later when he saw his ""treatment team,"" hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie, but he enthusiastically recommended it.  chasson also quoted from a   diary entry by hinckley in which he said ""psychiatry is a guessing game"" and doctors ""will never know the true john hinckley.""  ""the hospital does not  know what mr. hinckley is thinking, and he wants it that way,"" the prosecutor said.  hinckleys attorney, barry levine, said the issue is not whether hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.  ""this man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous,"" levine said. he added that hinckley is ""flawed"" but is ""fundamentally decent.""  levine said that in the two and a half decades that hinckley has been at st. elizabeths hospital in washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility, there has ""not been a single act of violence.""  since  , levine said, hinckley has been taking a drug called risperdal. medical websites describe risperdal as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.  dr. tyler jones, director of psychiatry at st. elizabeths, testified hinckley also started taking zoloft in   after complaining about anxiety.  jones said hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an american pecified psychotic disorder. but jones said hes been in remission for both of those disorders for many years. he said hinckley also suffers from narcissism, which has improved but is still present. jones said he has interviewed hinckley but has not treated him.  according to jones, hinckleys treatment team was informed by the secret service that hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits. jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with hinckley, who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal, but later understood it was a serious issue.  although concerned hinckley was not truthful about his activities, jones said, ""we did not  feel this constituted an increased risk."" the staff decided to reduce hinckleys christmas visit to his mother from   days to five days, and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that december stay. jones said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking hinckleys privileges altogether.  a september filing by prosecutors said hinckley ""continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women."" according to the document, in june of   he went on the internet to find photos of his female dentist. ""when he was caught, hinckley claimed, falsely, that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs.""  asked about the photographs of the dentist, jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were ""not salacious.""  he said the hospital considers hinckley ""a low risk of violence to himself and others.""  currently, hinckley is allowed to visit his mother   days a month. on july  , st. elizabeths hospital filed a proposal to increase that. the first step would allow hinckley to have two visits of   days. that would be followed by six visits of   days.  according to the september government filing opposing the plan, the hospital would then ""be given the sole discretion to place hinckley on convalescent leave in his mothers hometown.""  after the judge and all the lawyers were in place, hinckley, now  , entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket, dark pants and a striped tie. he shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down. american . district judge paul friedman greeted hinckley and he replied, saying, ""good morning.""  hinckleys defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify. prosecutors want to cross examine hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that.  mental health experts and secret service agents will testify, along with hinckleys brother and sister. hinckleys mother is now   years old and is not a scheduled witness.  it is  not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospitals plan to gradually allow hinckley greater freedom.  on march  ,  , hinckley waited for president reagan to leave a washington hotel after a speech. he opened fire and hit reagan, his press secretary james brady, secret service agent timothy mccarthy and washington police officer thomas delahanty. all survived, but brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech.  hinckley, who was   at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress jodie foster. he left a letter addressed to her in his washington hotel room saying, ""dear jodie. there is a definite possibility i will be killed in my attempt to get reagan.""","defense attorneys want john hinckley to be transitioned out of a mental hospital. ""the hospital does not  know what mr. hinckley is thinking,"" the prosecutor says. the hearing may determine whether to eventually free him from a mental hospital. after john hinckley shot reagan, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

"atlanta  cnn     republican presidential hopeful herman cain told supporters saturday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, which has become hobbled in recent weeks by allegations of sexual harassment and an atlanta womans claim that they carried on a   year affair.  while he will still be able to raise and spend campaign funds because he did not officially drop out, cains white house bid is effectively over.  cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife, his family and his supporters.  cain and his wife, gloria, held hands as they walked up to the podium where cain made his remarks in atlanta. the crowd chanted, ""gloria  gloria "" before the candidate spoke.  even as he stepped aside under the weight of the allegations that have dogged him, cain said that he was at ""peace with my god"" and ""peace with my wife.""  he repeatedly called the allegations ""false and untrue,"" and added that ""the  media  spin hurts.""  ""i am not going to be silenced and i will not go away,"" cain said, announcing what he called his plan b  a website, thecainsolutions.com, through which he will continue to advocate for his platform.  his catchy ""     "" economic plan is not going anywhere, he said.  ""your support has been unwavering and undying,"" cain told his supporters.  he will endorse another of the republican presidential hopefuls soon, he said.  other candidates were quick to react.  ""herman cain provided an important voice to this process,"" minnesota rep. michele bachmann said in a statement. ""his ideas and energy generated tremendous enthusiasm for the conservative movement at a time it was so desperately needed to restore confidence in our country.""  fellow georgian newt gingrich said the ""     "" plan ""got our country talking about the critical issue of how to reform our tax code and he elevated the dialogue of the republican presidential primary in the process.""  texas gov. rick perry said he knew the cains made a ""difficult decision. he helped invigorate conservative voters and our nation with a discussion of major tax reform.""  former utah gov. jon huntsman said cain brought ""a unique and valuable voice to the debate over how to reform our countrys uncompetitive tax code and turn around the economy. i understand his decision and wish him and his family the best.""  recently, cain acknowledged that ginger whites allegations of an affair have led to a drop in campaign contributions, and a des moines register poll showed his support among likely republican iowa caucus goers has fallen to   , down from    in october. the poll has a sampling error of plus or minus  .  points, the newspaper said.  respondents said they were most concerned that cain does not understand important issues, but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern, the newspaper said.  this week, white told the news media that she and cain engaged in an on and off affair for more than   years. she described the affair as ""very casual.""  white issued a statement, through her attorney, after cains announcement saturday.  ""ginger white respects mr. cains decision regarding his campaign and indeed would have respected any decision he made,"" the statement said. ""that being said, she is disappointed that he has not apologized for the public statements he has made about her and other women who have spoken out.""  in a fund raising letter tuesday night, cain referred to white as ""troubled.""  two women    sharon bialek and karen kraushaar    previously accused cain of sexually harassing them in the  s while he was head of the national restaurant association. two other women also have said cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association, but they have declined to be identified.  cain told the union leader in new hampshire that he repeatedly gave white money to help her with ""month to month bills and expenses."" but he denied the relationship was sexual, as white contends. he said the two were friends.  ""i send checks to a lot of people; i help a lot of people,"" cain told fox news on thursday. ""that in itself is not proof. so the other allegation in terms of it being a   year physical relationship, that is her words against my word.""  in the interview, cain said his wife, knew nothing about white nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week.  ""my wife now knows,"" he told the newspaper. ""my wife and i have talked about it, and i have explained it to her. my wife understands that i am  a soft hearted, giving person.""  cains announcement came a month before the iowa caucuses, the first formal test of the primary season, scheduled for january  .  new hampshire republican officials who supported cain began to survey their options saturday, with several state representatives saying their support could go to gingrich or ron paul. cains most prominent supporter in the state, former gop state party chair jack kimball, said he would wait to learn who cain would endorse before making his own decision.  cain told staffers earlier this week he was reassessing his campaign in the wake of whites allegation of an affair, and he acknowledged to reporters wednesday that her account had led to a drop in contributions to his campaign.  he said in the thursday union leader interview that his wifes feelings, as well as the reaction from supporters and donors, would be important factors in deciding whether he will stay the race.  cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to, but quickly added that she would not .  though gloria cain rarely makes public appearances or statements, she told fox news last month that she believed the sexual harassment allegations were ""unfounded.""  cnns rachel streitfeld contributed to this report.","new  woman who alleges an affair with cain wants an apology. cain will endorse another candidate soon. cains iowa support fell to single digits, the des moines register reports. candidate was dogged by allegations of sexual harassment and an affair.

'my eyes were opened'  though his trip was ""months in the works,"" stanton did not  anticipate that his arrival in erbil, iraq would coincide with that of isis. the first people he questioned were yazidi refugees who had only freshly fled their homes, their families, their lives as a whole.  ""my idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through,"" admits stanton.  for the yazidis he approached    from the student who had to abandon his long sought after masters degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children ca not  stop crying for home    stanton found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning.

" cnn     a new cnn poll confirms that we are  witnessing a quiet reversal in the character of our two major parties.  traditionally, republicans have always coalesced around the conventional wisdom front runner for president. conservatives respect structure, order and party brand names. not for nothing was the name nixon, bush or dole on the gop presidential ticket from   to  .  in contrast, democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand, rising from obscurity to the white house    think jimmy carter, bill clinton and barack obama.  but a fresh out of the oven cnn presidential poll shows a fractured gop field of newcomers with no clear front runner while the democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own  hillary clinton.  opinion  gop strategy on shutdown courts doom  yes, it is pathetically early to be projecting on the   presidential campaign. predictive capacity hovers somewhere near zero, and time fixated on polls would be productively used thinking about the   midterms or the fights over the debt ceiling looming over our divided, dysfunctional congress.  but as a snapshot of the underlying dynamics driving the two parties, this new poll is worth a look.  on the gop side of the aisle, new jersey gov. chris christie narrowly leads the fractured field at   , one point above rep. paul ryan, best known as mitt romneys vice presidential running mate. in the old days, the previous vice presidential nominee would be the future favorite. but that does not  seem to be the case for ryan, who emerged from the   presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the romney campaign.  traditionally, the governor of blue state new jersey would not  be on the gop radar at all, but christie    cruising to a landslide re election    seems to be the exception to this and other rules.  next on the list is rand paul, the scion of an outsider libertarian movement sparked by his dads multiple runs for president. but the compelling and controversial one time eye doctor is a first term senator from kentucky, far from your typical presidential timber.  perhaps most interesting is the second tier of gop candidates. jeb bush seems settled in at   , despite brand name and legendary brand loyalty. two hispanic senate republicans, marco rubio and ted cruz, come in next at    and    respectively. and then, at the bottom of the barrel, come two   aspirants  texas gov. rick perry and former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum.  far from being strengthened by their   campaigns, these two candidates seem weakened by the experience. rick perrys ""oops"" heard round the world still resonates while santorums strident social conservatism does not  seem to be taken seriously by    of the party faithful. strange days.  obama pressures conservative republicans over possible shutdown  the real news is on the democratic side. hillary clinton has accumulated a towering   percentage point lead over her next closest competitor, vice president joe biden, who is at    and does not  exactly lack name recognition.  below biden are first term massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren at   , new york gov. andrew cuomo at    and maryland gov. martin o'malley    perhaps the most openly ambitious of the bunch    at   .  clintons dominance illustrates an interesting dynamic. six years ago, she was a far more polarizing figure among democrats  and independents . today, after her service as secretary of state, she seems more qualified and less polarizing, transcending her association with the culture of wars concurrent with bubbas two terms in office.  tough and experienced, clinton is now positioned as a candidate who rivals obamas   surge. she will also be positioned as the candidate of the   , compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among republican women in this incarnation.  uncle joe biden is well liked by the rank and file, but there does not  seem to be much of a stampede to put him on the top of the ticket. warrens strength comes from fascination with the new and represents the growing strength of the liberal base in the party. and while successful governors like cuomo and o'malley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates, the party faithful do not  seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment.  if clinton does not run for some reason, democrats will quickly wake up to the awkward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two obama terms.  so there you have it  democrats are behaving like republicans, falling in line behind the big brand name dominating a race that is still three years away. and republicans are behaving like democrats, putting forward a fractured field with no clear front runners but elevating a new jersey governor, a wisconsin congressman and a kentucky senator to the front of the pack.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of john avlon.","john avlon  a new cnn poll shows a reversal in the character of two major parties. avlon  traditionally, gop coalesce around a front runner; democrats root for newcomers. now, gop has an eclectic pool of presidential candidates; democrats have hillary clinton. avlon  if clinton does not run, democrats will have almost no strong candidate.

" cnn     even during the harshest periods of the communist era, being shanghainese had a special cachet in china.  the city and its residents were a synonym for western fashion and open minded attitudes, as different as could be from their mao pin wearing comrades.  its personality remains just as strong today.  shanghai is an unusual place. it is  chinese, but not entirely; its hybrid of eastern and western business and social traditions is found nowhere else in mainland china.  here are the things that make chinas booming commercial hub a unique place in the worlds most populous country.  the bund  a number of pockets in china have impressive western buildings    the german quarter in qingdao, russian buildings in harbin    but none provide the surreal feeling of ""elsewhereness"" like the bund.  the bund refers to shanghais waterfront on the west bank of huangpu river.  two dozen colossal western structures, ranging in style from art deco to victorian gothic, stand side by side, forming a massive marble curtain.  view it from afar and you would  think you were sailing into liverpool. the  ,  meter long strip is a legacy passed down by one of the citys former rulers, great britain.  it was largely built in the late  th and early  th centuries to establish shanghai as the british empires trading hub of the far east.  the most magnificent building is todays number    , the former hsbc building. when completed in  , the seven story neoclassical landmark was dubbed ""the most luxurious building from the suez canal to the bering strait.""  the buildings original ceiling mural managed to survive the cultural revolution; the octagonal mosaic painting is one of the best kept secrets in shanghai. it is  now in the lobby of shanghai pudong development bank, the buildings current occupier.  with the financial centers move to the east bank of huangpu river, the old bund has become a new home for world class hotels, restaurants and retailers.  skyscrapers  according to emporis, a global real estate data provider based in germany, shanghai ranks sixth among world cities with the most skyscrapers.  there are   skyscrapers in shanghai, eight fewer than dubai,   more than in seoul and   more than the second mainland city on the list, guangzhou.  although towering blocks mushroom throughout the metropolis, the skyscraper center point is the lujiazui financial district.  on the opposite side of the traditional bund, lujiazui appears so futuristic that it is  become a hollywood favorite as a setting for films, most recently featured in ""her"" with joaquin phoenix.  lujiazui is home to the most recognized high rises in china, including the   meter oriental pearl tv tower, the   meter jinmao tower and the   meter shanghai world financial center. since  , each of them has had a turn as the tallest structure in china.  next in line is the   meter shanghai tower. scheduled to open in  , the   story building is set to host what it claims will be worlds tallest luxury hotel, j hotel.  the   room hotel    a joint venture between shanghai jinjiang hotel group and interstate hotels and resorts    will occupy the  th through  th floors of the shanghai tower.  international events and entertainment  when international events set up in china, shanghai is as often as not the default host city. large scale events in beijing tend to carry political messages, while those in shanghai focus more on fun and glamor.  the chinese formula one grand prix is one of the biggest annual events in shanghai. it is  the only formula one stop in mainland china.  the shanghai masters  october      tennis championship is attended by the highest ranking players of the year. the week long event is part of the atp world tour masters  .  shanghai is also building a disneyland. set to open toward the end of  , shanghai disneyland will be the first disney theme park in mainland china  hong kong disneyland opened in    and the sixth in the world.  the   .  billion investment will further promote mickey mouse and donald duck in the realm of the monkey king.  international food  high quality international restaurants are springing up in shanghai so quickly that it is  hard to keep track of them all.  new kitchens often set up on the bund, around xintiandi and in the former french concession, as rivals to the established fine dining scene in beijing.  but look beyond the glitzy restaurant menus and into the homes of private residents, and you will  see a tradition of international cuisine found nowhere else in china.  the citys british rulers and russian refugees may be long gone, but their food has remained.  worcestershire sauce, that classic condiment from the united kingdom, has a brother some  ,  kilometers from home. known locally as ""spicy soy sauce,"" shanghainese worcestershire sauce was first produced in   to cater to the large expat market.  nowadays, the yellow labeled bottle is ubiquitous in supermarkets. shanghainese usually use it to accompany deep fried pork chops.  when russians fleeing the october revolution of   came to shanghai, they brought their borscht. the hearty beef and vegetable soup has evolved into shanghais favorite comfort food. local mothers usually cook it to treat friends and families.  pidgin english  colonial history has trickled down to shanghais local lingo.  shanghai dialect is filed with localized english words and pidgin english cultural identifiers unique to shanghainese.  a spring lock is called ""si ba lin."" cement is ""si men ting."" in shanghainese, ""on sale"" can refer to a ""cheap"" person.  shanghai dialect is incomprehensible to a typical mandarin speaker, whose language is largely based on pronunciation and vocabulary from northern china.  shikumen  shikumen is shanghais indigenous alleyway housing.  series of stone buildings were built in the  s as a way to accommodate the citys rapidly growing immigrant families.  when the communist party took over in  , shikumen architecture was at its height    there were around  ,  shikumen buildings throughout central shanghai, each divided into tenements to house five or even ten families.  as modern high rises in shanghai have grabbed international attention, however, these local architectural treasures have been ignored or even shoved aside. since the  s, shikumen buildings have been getting pulled down more quickly than the skyscrapers rise.  but you can still find them in a few corners.  in xintiandi, high end restaurants, pubs and clubs have taken over the revamped old buildings. tianzifang is a more bohemian area. in its labyrinth of alleyways, indie designers hang up cocktail dresses next to self employed vendors selling replica communist souvenirs in the courtyard.  for more authentic shikumen neighborhoods, citãâ© bourgogne on shaanxi nan lu, and jing'an villa on nanjing xi lu, are throwbacks to a uniquely shanghai experience thats rapidly

"during   years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying, laurie halse anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys  why was the main character in her book, ""speak,"" so american et about what happened to her  did not  she want the attention of one of the popular boys  and why was the impact so traumatic   anderson, who published the award winning novel in  , believes the questions come from an honest place. they are  teen boys, after all, growing up in a society where media and pop culture tell them women are created for sexual gratification.  they are  not used to reading novels that feature characters like melinda sordino, a teen who is raped by a classmate at a house party. as her classmates and neighbors go to great lengths to protect her attacker, melinda plunges into near silence, refusing to say what happened while still feeling ostracized by her classmates.  fifteen years after its publication, society has shed some of the stigma associated with sexual violence, but the conflict at the heart of ""speak"" still shows up in headlines, from steubenville, ohio, to maryville, missouri.  and yet, many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and intimacy, anderson said. as a mother who raised four girls, anderson knows that parents today are navigating uncharted territory when it comes to adolescent sexuality, and they are  doing it earlier than parents in other generations.  talking to teens about sexuality, intimacy and consent is urgent, she said.  ""we have  fallen down on our responsibility to our children by somehow creating this world where they are  surrounded by images of sexuality; and yet, we as adults struggle to talk to kids honestly about sex, the rules of dignity and consent,"" she said.  ""so many teens out there are operating in a vacuum, they are  operating in adult situations without any adult support or advice.""  for the  th anniversary of ""speak,"" anderson is lending her support  to the rape, abuse   incest national network, a resource for survivors of sexual violence. macmillan, the publisher of ""speak,"" is matching donations to the organization in april, which is sexual assault awareness month.  anderson said she wrote ""speak"" based on her own experience of being raped as a teen. she struggled for years to find the words or the courage to express what she would  gone through.  much has changed since then, she said, and ""speak"" has become required reading in some schools across the country.  scores of students still describe the same struggles to anderson, and she often directs them to the rainn hot line, she said. over the years, more resources have emerged for survivors of sexual violence, especially online. today, if you are  a victim of any crime, including sexual violence, you can go online and ""find someone whos walked in your shoes who can help you make sense of what happened,"" she said.  ""i do see reduction of shame, which is very good. we still have a long way to go yet.thats the reason many victims do not  come forward. that feeling is understandable, but it is  why we still need to do more to reduce the stigma around rape,"" she said.  while the internet brings people together and creates supportive communities, it has also become the source of damaging images and intense bullying, she said.  ""we as a culture are still figuring out how to teach our children the awesome parts of the internet and cell phones and new media, but we also have to figure out how to keep them safe,"" she said.  although many students first encountered ""speak"" in high schools, it is  now being taught in middle schools, anderson said. she thinks it is  an acknowledgment that sex education needs to start earlier if we want to help teens feel comfortable talking openly about sex and what feels right and wrong.  she believes parents can be more involved, too; just take a deep breath and commit to talking about sex and what constitutes consent, she said.  ""because boys and girls can be victims of rape, we need to try to teach them to make decisions about life that keep them safe, sober and with people they can trust, and make sure people who might be inclined to rape    who think they can get away with it    know they ca not  get away from it.  ""it used to be that we teach girls not to be raped, but we need to start teaching boys not to be rapists, and thats a really hard thing for parents of boys to process,"" she said. ""no one wants to think of their sons as rapists.  ""we are a culture who is right now in   finally having the conversation that it actually does not  matter what a woman is wearing, you are  not supposed to rape her. i think we are  all trying to find the right language surrounding sexual assault. i am  optimistic  that we are  heading in a better direction as a culture.""  the term ""young adult lit"" was hardly in use when anderson wrote ""speak."" she did not  set out to be a public touchstone in the genre, she said.  a teacher who uses ""speak"" in her classroom told anderson that she calls it ""resilience literature,"" a term anderson said she is proud of.  ""speak"" is about teen rape, the pressures of high school and the insularity of small town life, but most importantly, it is  about overcoming stigma, anderson said.  ""that can be the most painstaking aspect of being a teen, figuring out what the world really looks like,"" she said. ""if you find someone in a book, you know you are  not alone and thats what is  so comforting about books.""","real talk about sex among families is more important than ever, ""speak"" author says. laurie halse andersons acclaimed young adult novel ""speak"" turns   this year. the novels central themes    teen rape and stigma    are still relevant, anderson says.

"los angeles, california  cnn     former detainees of immigration and customs enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.  raymond soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ice agents against his will.  one of the drugs in question is the potent anti psychotic drug haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.  two immigrants, raymond soeoth of indonesia and amadou diouf of senegal in west africa, told cnn they were injected with the drugs against their will.  both are plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union against the government. they are seeking an end to the alleged practice and american pecified damages.  watch why the former detainees claim abuse â»  dr. paul appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at columbia university, reviewed both mens medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.  ""i am  really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,"" said appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the american academy of psychiatry and the law.  ""that is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.""  the allegations of ice forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by sen. joe lieberman, i connecticut, during the re nomination hearing of ice chief julie myers.  ""the information the committee has received from ice regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ice may have violated its own detention standards,"" lieberman spokeswoman leslie phillips told cnn in an email.  ""senator lieberman intends to follow up with ice to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.""  aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham, who is representing soeoth and diouf, said, ""it would be torture to give a powerful anti psychotic drug to somebody who is not  even mentally ill. ... but here, it is  happening on american . soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.""  responding to liebermans written questions, myers said  ,  immigration detainees had ""medical escorts"" for deportation since  .  from october last year to the end of april this year, she said   received psychotropic medications during the removal process. of those,   detainees received medication ""because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,"" she said.  ""first, i am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ice detention standards,"" myers said.  she added no detainee should be ""involuntarily medicated without court order,"" except in emergency situations.  but both soeoth and diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.  soeoth, a christian minister from indonesia, spent   months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. hours before he was to be sent back home on december  ,  , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. see the document that shows soeoth was injected  ""they pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,"" he said through broken english.  he says he was taken to los angeles international airport while in this drug induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ice agents returned him to his cell at terminal island near los angeles. terminal island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.  soeoths medical records indicate he was injected with cogentin and haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.  in the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported    a remark soeoth denies ever making.  ice said in a written statement it could not  respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.  ""department of homeland security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,"" the ice statement said. ""only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the american . public health service, may prescribe or administer medication.""  but, diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. he said he even had a federal stay of his deportation    and the paperwork to prove it    but his american . government escorts would not  let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. see dioufs stay of deportation document  thats when, he says, ""i was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.""  a government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.  in both cases, diouf and soeoth remain in the united states pending a decision in the case. if they lose, they may land back in the hands of ice, once again facing deportation.  soeoth says hes traumatized by what happened.

"an   year old boys rendition of the national anthem at game   of the nba finals brought the usual appreciative applause tuesday, but outside at t center in san antonio, his performance brought a darker reaction from some posters on social media    and eventually an online backlash against their racist comments.  see the performance by sebastien de la cruz  heres a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the internet about sebastien de la cruz      ""why they got a mexican kid singing the national anthem      "" from daniel gilmore.     ""how you singing the national anthem looking like an illegal immigrant"" from andre lacey, proud father and firefighter from augusta, georgia.     ""why is a foreigner singing the national anthem. i realize thats san antonio but that still ai not  mexico"" from lewie groh.     ""who let this illegal alien sing our national anthem "" from matt cyrus.  and the list went on and on.  as for sebastien, he said the racist comments have not fazed him.  ""for those that said something bad about me, i understand it is  your opinion,"" said sebastien to cnn. ""i am  a proud american and live in a free country. it is  not hurting me. it is  just your opinion.""  sebastien has been singing since he was   but gained fame in   after being on nbcs ""americas got talent"" for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem.  juan de la cruz, sebastiens father, has not  taken the negative comments personally at all.  ""when he was on 'americas got talent,' he faced racism there, too. you ca not  satisfy everyone,"" said de la cruz to cnn.  ""i think people reacted the way they did because sebastien was wearing his mariachi outfit,"" said de la cruz, ""but, it does not  make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive. san antonio supports sebastien.""  a collection of the negative tweets was posted on public shaming, a tumblr blog dedicated to outing and shaming racists' social media  posts. other media outlets used that post as the foundation for the story, and the story took off from there.  the blog highlighted   tweets from nba fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the spurs would allow the boy, who happened to have been born and raised in san antonio, to sing the nations anthem.  however, public shaming must have suspected what would happen once the racist tweets were posted because most of the twitter handles have been deactivated or the tweet has been removed. the blog posted screen shots of the tweets so it could continue to display the public microbloggers' rants.  after the harsh reaction spread across the internet, tweets supporting and defending sebastien and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over      ""that little   year old mariachi national anthem singer has more talent and grace than the combined racist pig idiots on twitter,"" from mexican american cartoonist lalo alcaraz     ""racist scumbag says chicano kid singing nat'l anthem just ""snuck into the country."" this idiots apparently of color too.  a dao,"" from laura gonzalez, a chicana santa rosa city schools board member and middle school teacher.

""taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families    a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long term damage on their chances of recovery,"" whitbread said.  hurriedly whisking unclassified children out of haiti will not ensure the children are happy or safe in the long term, experts said. homes and potential parents must be reviewed by professional social workers and it is  logistically impossible to do that in a short time. allowing adoptions to proceed without thorough background checks can lead to child trafficking and other crimes.  the united nations childrens fund, or unicef, does not facilitate adoptions, but it has been bombarded with calls from people who want a haitian orphan, said christopher de bono, a unicef spokesman.  in  , unicef estimated that there were  ,  orphans in haiti, but de bono said thursday that he would  ""hate to vouch for that figure"" because that number    any number    is impossible to verify.  between haitis ""lousy [child welfare] oversight system,"" and all the challenges that haitians have endured, it is  not uncommon for haitian parents to put their children in orphanages temporarily, de bono said. this means knowing who is truly an orphan and who is not  requires great attention to detail and documents.  ""removing children who have  just experienced a disaster from their environment, from where they are  from is not necessarily good for them,"" he said. haitian children must first be fed, sheltered, clothed and given medical attention; the next step is to register them and trace their relatives.  diana boni, who works with port au princes bresma orphanage, is firmly against new adoptions out of haiti. ""under no circumstances should we evacuate any child newly orphaned or displaced,"" she wrote in an email to cnn.

"washington  cnn     a former middle school student who was strip searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her supreme court appeal thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety.  savana redding leaves the american  supreme court in april. she was   when she was strip searched.  savana redding was   when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs.  no medication was found, and she later sued.  the justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued.  the larger issue of whether a campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court.  ""savanas subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening and humiliating,"" wrote justice david souter for the majority, likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week.  but reflecting the divisiveness over the issue, souter said, ""we think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case.""  whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court.  ""i am  pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that,"" redding said from her hobbs, new mexico, home after the ruling was announced.  ""i am  pretty certain that it is  so far less likely to happen again"" to other students.  redding was an eighth grade honor student in  , with no history of disciplinary problems at safford middle school, about   miles from tucson, arizona.  during an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that redding had given her prescription strength   milligram ibuprofen pills.  the school had a near zero tolerance policy for all prescription and over the counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission.  redding was pulled from class by vice principal kerry wilson, escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence. the girl denied the accusations.  a search of reddings backpack found nothing. a strip search was conducted by wilsons assistant and a school nurse, both females.  redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records. no drugs were found.  ""the strip search was the most humiliating experience i have ever had,"" redding said in an affidavit. ""i held my head down so that they could not see that i was about to cry.""  souter said wilson initially had ""sufficient suspicion"" to justify searching the girls backpack and outer clothing. but when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear.  with the help of the american civil liberties union, redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in san francisco ruled against the school, calling the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. that court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug  and crime free classroom.  the supreme court found little agreement on key issues. justices john paul stevens and ruth bader ginsburg agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by redding.  ""wilsons treatment of redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it,"" said ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in april, criticizing the schools actions.  but justice clarence thomas took the opposite view  that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible.  ""preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the constitution,"" he said. ""and, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative.""  in  , the high court allowed the search of a students purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes. such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive.""  opinions in   and   allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities.  the court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over.  adam wolf, an aclu attorney who represented redding, applauded the decision.  ""when parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials,"" wolf said .  but school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier.  ""the home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students, who may take those medications for abusive purposes,"" said francisco negron, general counsel for the national school boards association. ""thats a problem schools are trying to stem.""  ""how they determine now whether the drug is dangerous, whether it is  not dangerous    that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance, the court did not give us.""  redding, now  , said she has never gotten over her experience.  ""before it happened, i loved school, loved everything about it. you know, i had a  .  gpa, honor roll, and now, well, afterwards i never wanted to go to school again.""  she is attending college.  the case is safford unified school district no.   v. redding      .","savana redding was   when administrators suspected she was carrying drugs. no medication was found, and she later sued. justices  search was unreasonable, but individual school officials ca not  be sued. redding, now  , has said she has never gotten over her experience.

""mao was front page news in america and that was often where warhol got his biggest inspiration,"" said eric shiner, director of pittsburghs andy warhol museum, which organized the exhibition. he described mao as ""classic warhol subject matter.""  warhol relied on a copy of maos portrait photograph in the leaders little red book of ideological quotations to create his paintings. little did he know that he would eventually pose for a photo in front of the original portrait hanging in beijings tiananmen square.  his trip to beijing was an unexpected byproduct of a visit to hong kong. the industrialist alfred siu had invited him to the city to attend the opening of a night club, decorated with portraits of britains prince charles and princess diana that he had commissioned from the artist. upon warhols arrival, siu announced he had arranged a vip tour to beijing for him and his friends.  artistic inspiration aside, china also provided warhol with a respite from the pressures of fame. ""it was one of the special places,"" said christopher makos, the artists close friend and personal photographer, who accompanied him to china.  he recalled that warhol went virtually unrecognized in china, although the artist stood out for his unusual looks. ""as andy would say, he did not  have to wear his andy suit. notoriety and fame is a double edged sword....you have no privacy.""  chinas communist uniformity, with its blue sea of unisex mao suits, appealed to warhols aesthetic obsession with repetition. ""he was all about multiples...and at the time, china was the ultimate multiple,"" makos said.  the country also provided a source of inspiration for warhols nascent modeling career. warhol posed for makos' camera with gestures he adopted from the tai chi practitioners he observed outdoors    and even adopted the bared teeth expression of the guardian lion in the forbidden city in one photo.  can warhol make a name in china   while warhol is well known within art and fashion circles in china  shiner said   of these cultural elite attended the exhibitions pre opening , he remains unknown to the average chinese citizen.  many chinese are familiar with certain warhol works, such as the marilyn monroe or the chairman mao portraits, reproductions of which dot cafes and tourist markets across beijing. but they are much less likely to connect the work with the artist    or to even have heard of the artist himself.  ""if you do not  know who andy warhol is, i wo not  blame you. but if you say you have  never seen his marilyn monroe portrait, i would have to jump into the huangpu river and kill myself "" wrote user  jianisi yangyang on sina weibo. a search on chinas popular twitter like platform revealed many posts by users expressing ignorance of whom warhol was or why he is famous.  having recently launched a ""massive"" advertising campaign and sat for dozens of interviews with mainland media outlets, shiner is hoping to reach the masses.  ""one of the reasons why i wanted to do this show is so the general public can learn about the artist behind these iconic works and realize  mao and marilyn monroe  are just a few of thousands of images he made,"" he said.  so far, it appears that this education is welcome    and necessary. ""for the first time, i learned the charm of pop art,"" weibo user  yanmingdu wrote about the exhibition, while user  graciemankedun posted, ""just saw andy warhols exhibition and i got a little confused. for example, i did not  understand the campbells soup cans.""  ""the curiosity is greater than the awareness,"" said john good, international director for post war and contemporary art at christies, which is holding its second private sale of warhols work in hong kong this week. ""we have  seen a great deal of interest and curiosity  among chinese  about western art and international culture. i think warhol is a perfect artist...to show what western culture is all about.""  christies first private warhol sale in hong kong last november attracted a mostly asian demographic and managed to sell nearly half of its lots, good said.  censoring mao in china  however, visitors to the ""  minutes external"" exhibitions in mainland china will not see any chairman mao portraits. while shiner was planning the exhibition with the host venue    the shanghai power station of art    its staff advised that exhibiting the mao works was not  a ""good idea right now."" a staff member told cnn that government authorities would have considered the works ""too political.""  ""of course, the primary concern is to get the show there and up and not put anything in a category that would ever question anything,"" shiner said. ""knowing that we would have the censors from the ministry of culture, we wanted to make sure... that nothing would put the show in jeopardy.""  an editorial in the state backed global times newspaper suggested that while warhol may not have had ill intent, the ""provocative"" blotches of color splattered on maos face suggested that he was wearing make up    a disrespectful portrayal of the iconic leader.  while shiner acknowledged the mao portraits ""could be read as a sarcastic or ironic portrayal"", he said warhol ""definitely was not  being critical. he always liked to blur the lines on gender, and making colorful men somewhat beautiful was something that he liked to do as an inside joke,"" he added.  once the chinese public gains a deeper understanding of warhols work, he expects that the mao works ""wo not  be as big a deal.""  influence on chinese contemporary art  warhols influence on chinese contemporary art can actually be traced back to  , when many contemporary artists, labeled as dissidents, fled the country, shiner said. while most of them went to paris and berlin, two artists ""very specifically went to new york because they wanted quite literally to be part of andys universe""    ai weiwei and xu bing.  both artists have gone on to become some of the most recognized and celebrated names in chinese contemporary art, and some would go as far as calling ai weiwei ""chinas andy warhol.""  ""ai weiwei loves the idea of multiples,"" makos pointed out, noting ais most famous installations, including the  ,  backpacks representing the schoolchildren killed in the   sichuan earthquake, and the millions of porcelain sunflower seeds he poured into the turbine hall of londons tate modern museum.  shiner readily concurred  ""hes really gone on to model his entire art making process and career on proven warhol tactics, looking at repetition, multiplication, and critique of consumer culture. when you look at his coca cola works, thats directly related to warhol and it is  really amazing how many things he picked up from andy."" ais similarity to warhol also lies in his social activism, which aims to change chinese society through art, he added.  as for xu bing, viewers may not immediately see warhol in his work, shiner said, but he described the artist as a ""huge fan of warhol"" who ""loves the idea of repetition    the formal arrangement of chinese character after chinese character, an endless array of similar looking imagery.""  unfortunately, neither artist became acquainted in person with their muse, despite moving to new york for him. ai once spotted warhol at a party, but did not approach him, shiner revealed. ""as a young man, he was too shy to actually go and say hello,"" he said, recalling that ai told him his english was not  good enough at the time.  ai and xu aside, the warhol aesthetic and vocabulary has deeply influenced chinese contemporary artists over the past     years, with its characteristic combinations of social realist imagery with pop culture and iconic brands.  the shanghai exhibition will run to july   and make its way to beijing later this year. meanwhile, makos will also hold an exhibition of his photographs of warhol next month in shanghai, including images from their   trip to china.  ""his work lives on. maybe  the chinese  do not  know him, but they know his work,"" makos said, predicting that warhol ""will get bigger and bigger in china.""  ""andy was the ultimate pop artist. to this day you can still find campbell soup on the shelf in the grocery store and you can see multiples of them,"" makos said. ""as long as that imagery is live and well, warhol will have this built in publicity.""  cnns feng ke contributed to this report.","first major retrospective of pop artist andy warhols work exhibiting in china. warhol made first and only trip to china in  , which provided artistic inspiration. while iconic works are well recognized in china, few people connect them with warhol. warhol influenced chinese contemporary artists, most notably ai weiwei and xu bing.

"london  cnn     il rottomatore    or ""the demolition man""    is how italys incoming prime minister has come to be known, thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics.  matteo renzis nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up support in one of the most fractious governing systems on the planet, one which has speared all but one of its governments since world war ii.  then again, the   year olds backers say this football fan mayor of florence is precisely the breath of fresh air needed in romes stuffy halls of power.  neither an mp nor an elected premier, renzi has managed to wrest control of the partys leadership by promising to smash the gridlocked reform process and shift its axis to the center.  how he thinks he will manage to garner more support than career politicians, like his predecessor enrico letta, is as yet unclear.  what is  more  renzi had initially vowed only to seek the top job through the ballot box and not a leadership contest, meaning some are skeptical about what he stands for.  ''what renzis done is gutsy,'' says giuseppe ragusa of the luiss guido carli university in rome. ''but he is not going to have the publics support; he does not  have the votes from the electoral poll. so this is going to be a difficulty.  instead ragusa says italy is hoping that by virtue of his youth and dynamism renzi will have the energy ''to do something very quickly.""  something, being the optimal word.  italy has been crying out for a plausible, long term economic agenda for years, leaving the country wholly unprepared for the economic slump of recent years.  often described as his countrys answer to tony blair, renzi is good at talking the big picture, which is probably just as well because italys problems are not  small.  first theres a two trillion euro debt pile to shrink, record unemployment, crippling and antiquated labor laws not to mention stifling business and payroll taxes.  still, top of the list for renzi, will be moves to create the kind of political stability where such measures can actually take hold.  this means ploughing on with plans to reform the parliamentary system in a move which is likely to cost the country its upper house    or senate    in its current form.  however, renzi may be on a collision course with brussels after suggesting the eu give his nation some leeway to breach its    limit on the budget deficit in order to support a recent return to growth.  vincenzo scarpetta of london based think tank open europe says renzi will have to prove himself on the international stage. ''he is relatively little known compared to his two predecessors,'' says scarpetta. 'so he will have to act quickly.''  yet if anything, renzi is a long distance player.  a marathon runner and keen sportsman, renzi already has an eye on the distant horizon    saying he wishes to see this term through until the next election in  .  addressing reporters after being asked to form a government by italys president    as protocol dictates    renzi said it would likely take a few days to get his key people in place. ''but i assure you,'' he said, ''i will give this commitment all the energy i have.''  commitment is something this former boy scout is known for and at less than half of the age of silvio berlusconi, renzi certainly has energy.  but he will  need more than stamina to succeed. above all, he must find support.  read more  is matteo renzi ready to be italys pm   watch more  the future of europes economy","matteo renzi is incoming pm of italy, a country with a fractious governing system. it is  not clear how the   year old will garner more support than his predecessors. the country has problems including its two trillion euro debt pile and high unemployment. but renzi has shown he is a long distance player    and has youth and stamina on his side.

""the murder was no accident,"" judge joseph bulone said.  wade went to trial in july, accused of second degree murder in the stabbing death of   year old sarah ludemann. the two women, only teenagers at the time, had fought for months via voicemails, text messages and myspace postings over their relationship with the same man, joshua camacho.  the feud culminated in a fatal confrontation in the early morning hours of april  ,  .  after a three day trial and only two and a half hours of deliberation, a jury of five men and one woman convicted wade of second degree murder. wade had claimed self defense and hoped for an acquittal or no more than a manslaughter conviction.  a life sentence was recommended by florida prosecutors. the defense had recommended   years, followed by   years of probation.  trutvs ""in session"" correspondent beth karas spoke to wade days before her sentencing.

""i do not  think we can appreciate how young people talk,"" he said. ""and thats the lesson for parents. pay close attention to your children. watch how they talk and who they talk to. watch their social networking outlets.""

"why in the world would scott brown, a former half term senator from mitt romneys massachusetts, put himself in the mix for the   republican presidential nomination   the real question is  why not   when brown told the des moines register over the weekend that he was heading to the iowa state fair ""to determine whether theres an interest in my brand of leadership and republicanism,"" the news was met with some amusement by political insiders.  after all, brown has already floated bids for new hampshire senator and massachusetts governor, and he does not  seem likely to pursue either.    watch  scott brown makes a stop in iowa  brown was thumped by elizabeth warren in his   re election bid, and he became something of a punch line earlier this year after he unleashed a volley of questionable late night tweets at some online critics.  but so what   the truth is that in todays media environment, theres almost no downside for a long shot ""candidate"" like brown to tell people hes mulling a white house run. for someone with no real perch other than a paid gig at fox news, it actually makes a lot of sense.  just by going to the iowa state fair, a must do for any ambitious pol, brown will be rewarded with the only currency that matters in modern campaign politics  other than hard fundraising dollars   buzz.  ""funnel cake and free name id. what is  not to love "" asked will ritter, a boston based gop operative and former mitt romney adviser. ""how many stories got posted about ed markeys legislative agenda yesterday  it is  fun. senator browns a skilled retail politician and this gives him a platform to talk about a brand of republicanism we could use more of.""  for obsessive political watchers, browns shamelessness about the whole enterprise is kind of refreshing.  ""i do admire the audacity to just go to the state fair and tweet about it,"" said jeff smith, a professor at the new school and regular contributor to the washington twitter conversation.  brown knows exactly what hes doing.  scott brown stirs speculation with new hampshire visit  it is  the same reason iowa rep. steve king and new york rep. peter king  no relation; not even close  are ""refusing to rule out"" a   bid.  will either of them be taking the oath of office one day  nope. but with so many news platforms to fill    on television, on the web, on the radio    a presidential trial balloon or a trip to iowa is almost guaranteed to get you at least a crumb of media exposure, a boost in stature, and maybe even a few campaign contributions down the road.  just look at this months family leadership summit, a gathering of social conservatives in iowa that drew potential   presidential contenders ted cruz and rick santorum to the first in the nation caucus state.  both men seem likely to run for the republican nomination, and both will be returning to iowa over and over and over again in the coming years. but even if they do not , the two conservatives proved how keeping ones name in the   conversation is its own reward.  in their speeches, cruz and santorum issued a series of anti obama bromides and boosted their profiles with the grassroots activists who attended the iowa summit. neither republican did a single thing to advance the news cycle other than board an airplane to des moines.  yet there they were, trailed at every turn by reporters from the washington post, des moines register, associated press, new york times, dallas morning news, wall street journal, nbc news, abc news and fox news.  another cruz trip to iowa stokes   speculation  ""the focus on the   presidential contest is completely ridiculous, and everybody knows it,"" wrote david weigel of slate after witnessing the cattle call.  well, not completely. in our atomized media ecosystem, theres certainly a market for niche political coverage, in the same way theres a market for micro reporting on the status of robert griffin iiis return from knee surgery.  more importantly, the presidential cycle is starting earlier than it ever has, with advisers to likely candidates working behind the scenes to assemble campaign infrastructure and peddle dirt on their potential opponents.  on the republican side, kentucky sen. rand paul and new jersey gov. chris christie are driving national discussions about ideology and governance.  still, theres a difference between running for president and ""running"" for president, even though it is  sometimes difficult to tell the difference.  running for president requires hard work, an ungodly amount of fundraising effort, a professional team of advisers, polling, a paid media strategy, a voter contact operation and ballot access. see  romney, mitt.  ""running"" for president means doing a lot of interviews and delivering some well timed lines in debates. see  cain, herman.  which category does scott brown fall under  for the moment, it would seem the latter.  looking at the   gop field, christie probably has the northeastern republican lane all to himself, a prospect that would make it difficult for brown to raise money. before his iowa trip, brown met privately with christie at the republican national committees summer conference in boston, a meeting first reported by the new york times.  christie raised money for brown several times during his senate tenure, and, according to one christie insider, the two are ""very friendly.""  then theres the fact that brown, who supports some abortion rights, is not  exactly a hardliner on social issues that matter to so many republican caucus goers in iowa.  even some of his former advisers are not  sure what hes up to. eric fehrnstrom, the media strategist who crafted browns truck driving, regular guy image during his stunning   senate american et, is not currently advising him, republican sources told cnn.  asked by text message if hes serious about a presidential bid, one republican who talks to brown often responded  ""who knows. you should call him and ask.""

" cnn     what would we lose if we lost  ,  postal jobs   ,  proposed through layoffs,  ,  through attrition ,  ,  post offices,   mail processing plants, or even the post office itself   with millions of jobs and businesses lost to the recent recession, these may seem like just more numbers, or more seemingly inevitable ""facts""    that in the electronic age we now rely on the private sector to deliver public services. but postal workers are people we depend on and post offices are places we want to know will always be there.  downsizing the american  postal service    which is so low on money, it is  in imminent danger of default    may seem like a ripple in this troubled economy, but it promises to be a social tsunami if action is not  taken soon to save it.  for one thing, the postal service has been a huge employer. before i became a history professor i carried mail for the postal service for   years. as with many government jobs, you are  hired for this one based on achieving a high score on a competitive exam. veterans, roughly    of todays postal workforce  though once well over     earn extra points on this exam, thus giving them a head start and a job to come home to after military service.  who were my co workers  just everyday people who, like me in  , were attracted to a job that had good benefits, job security, and started at   .  an hour. this was as a result of the   nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in new york after postal workers declared they were tired of earning   .  an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet.  in collecting oral histories for a book i later wrote on the postal service, i interviewed those who had worked before  , including those who struck. the postal workers job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers, delivering it as letter carriers, driving it as truck drivers, and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles, buildings, and grounds. above all, postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public.  the job allowed many to move into the ranks of middle class wage earners, where they were able to buy homes and send their children to college. but they were also members of extended families and community networks. many started small businesses on the side, adopted foster children, were active in civic organizations, or enrolled in college classes. their jobs mattered to communities.  postal jobs have especially played a key role in black community development. the post office has long been one of the largest employers of african americans. even as they faced discrimination at other jobs, many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts. by  , they had become twice as likely as whites to work for the post office, and even before the wage bump that year, the job had afforded them a middle class status and the ability to accumulate wealth.  today the nation relies on a vast mailing industry that operates primarily for profit. but that network is underpinned by the american . postal service    a self supporting quasi corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate.  many americans may not realize that it was the post office that pioneered parcel post in   in response to the overpriced, poor, and inconsistent service disaster that was private package delivery. or that the usps came up with the concept of overnight mail and zip codes that american  and fedex rely on so heavily in their business.  many do not  make the connection that e commerce not only competes with but also generates american . mail. or that during the turn of this century    the postal services peak years of revenue and mail handling    it was common to hear competitors and political ideologues calling for the agencys privatization, while at the same time blocking usps innovations like the proposed   global postal link program to help expedite parcels through customs.   or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the   postal accountability and enhancement act, signed by president george w. bush, which forces the postal service to pre fund its retiree health benefits   years into the future over the next   years. what should have been annual revenue surpluses for the postal service over the last decade have instead contributed to nightmare annual deficits as it is forced to pay   .  billion a year out of operating funds to satisfy this united nations ecessary and devastating mandate. .  we lose more than numbers when we lose postal jobs and post offices, or even the existence of a universal postal service. we lose more than just people committed to providing service, but also people engaged with their communities. people able to consume goods that others produce to help drive local economies.  we would also lose the promise of jobs in the future that provide what has become a more dependable service over two centuries since the founding of this country  the post office was started in   . an alternative to this loss  people could demand that congress treat the postal service as a venerable american institution worthy of fulfilling its enduring mandate, for which it has recruited generations of skilled and dedicated professional government employees.  a good start would be h.r.  , introduced by rep. stephen lynch, d massachusetts, a bill that would at least allow the postal service to transfer surplus pension funds to satisfy the retiree health plan pre fund requirement. and that pre fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the postal service from running off the rails.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of philip f. rubio","philip rubio says the american . postal service threatened by major cuts or even closure. he says post office represents people, places we rely on; cuts will have huge effect in american .. he says it is  a major employer, innovator and fulcrum of national communications system. rubio  congress must assume responsibilty for finding a way for postal service to stay afloat.

" cnn     the american . relationship with president hosni mubaraks egypt is full of contradictions and tensions, according to recently published american . diplomatic cables, but is also underpinned by similar basic interests in a rough and unpredictable part of the world.  a cnn analysis of secret and confidential cables published by wikileaks and its media partners reveals american . frustration with mubaraks lack of succession planning, concerns over stuttering economic reform and private criticism of the mubarak governments hard line toward domestic opponents.  but the cables also show that washington sees egypt as an important and    until now    stable ally on issues, including irans nuclear program, promoting negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority and making life difficult for hamas in gaza.  and above all, egypt is regarded as a moderate bulwark against iranian sponsored islamist fundamentalism.  the cables show that mubarak has taken a persistently hard line toward iran, telling american . diplomats in   that he had warned tehran ""not to provoke the americans"" on the nuclear issue and insisting egypt could never accept a nuclear armed iran.  mubarak has also repeatedly warned of irans influence with hamas in gaza and hezbollah in lebanon, and in a cable from february last year, was quoted as describing ""tehrans hand moving with ease throughout the region, from the gulf to morocco.""  a   cable noted that with ""the discovery of a hezbollah cell in egypt, the egyptians appear more willing to confront the iranian surrogates and to work closely with israel."" to that end, the cables describe the mubarak government as a helpful partner in stopping smuggling into gaza from egypt. a cable from   quoted a senior egyptian military figure as stating that egypt had spent approximately    million to purchase the steel for an underground wall on the gaza border, ""and egypt was paying the cost of this wall in terms of public opinion both within egypt and the region.""  there is no guarantee that any ""successor"" to the mubarak government would take such a hard line with hamas.  for the american ., the alliance between egypt and saudi arabia has also been an important counterweight to growing iranian influence on the ""arab street"" and among states such as syria and qatar.  egyptian officials, from mubarak down, have also repeatedly impressed upon visiting americans    military, diplomatic and congressional    that it alone among arab states can play a mediating role between israel and the palestinians. [egypt signed a peace treaty with israel in  , and mubarak has resisted popular opposition to it.]  ahead of mubaraks visit to washington in may  , ambassador margaret scobey wrote from cairo that ""the egyptians want the visit to demonstrate that egypt remains americas indispensable ""arab ally.""  scobey continued that mubarak was ""a tried and true realist, innately cautious and conservative, and has little time for idealistic goals.""  he viewed himself as ""someone who is tough but fair, who ensures the basic needs of his people.""  at the same time, the mubarak government has been very sensitive to any perceived slight from washington. it has complained about cuts in american . economic aid and a stagnant level of military aid ""because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship"" according to one cable.  on pressure to improve human rights, according to one cable from scobey in  , ""mubarak takes this issue personally, and it makes him seethe when we raise it, particularly in public.""  in a later cable, she said that mubarak ""harkens back to the shah of iran  the american . encouraged him to accept reforms, only to watch the country fall into the hands of revolutionary religious extremists.""  the egyptian president relied on his interior minister and intelligence service to ""keep the domestic beasts at bay, and mubarak is not one to lose sleep over their tactics.""  the american . cables display frustration with mubaraks reluctance to address human rights issues, with one in   saying  ""while egypt has made some limited gains over the last several years, such as on freedom of the press, progress overall has been slow.""  in a later cable, scobey suggested the new american . secretary of state, hillary clinton ""may wish to lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns."" but given mubaraks sensitivities, the american . has trodden carefully in pressing the egyptian government on human rights. a cable from   said the united states now avoided ""the public confrontations that had become routine over the past several years"" over human rights.  over the past five years, the cables reveal a growing unease with the lack of a succession plan, and apprehension about the prospect of mubaraks younger son, gamal, taking over from his father. as far back as april  , one cable observed that mubaraks wife, suzanne, was their sons ""most ardent booster"" but added  ""the possibility that gamal might succeed his father remains deeply unpopular on the street.""  it adds that ""unlike his father,  gamal  cannot take the militarys support for granted,"" having never served as an officer. but the same cable laments the lack of obvious contenders to succeed the aging mubarak    a situation that appears to hold today.  scobey wrote in apparent frustration two years ago that mubarak ""seems to be trusting to god and the ubiquitous military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly transition.""  recent events may have eroded that confidence, but one cable in   pointed out that egypts internal security apparatus, ""an estimated  .  million strong, is at least twice the size it was under sadat ... and makes any kind of violent change of leader unlikely.""  that perspective is now being challenged    and the role of the military may be critical in deciding the outcome. a cable from   cites egyptian experts as describing a ""disgruntled mid level officer corps"" with military salaries falling far behind the civilian sector and the top brass averse to gamal succeeding his father.  egyptian commentators also noted that many officers were frustrated that loyalty to the regime trumped competence, and that the best military talent was sidelined in case it should pose a threat to the government. even so, one cable concludes  ""the military still remains a potent political and economic force.""  after discussing whether the military might step in to prevent mubarak from passing the baton to his son, the cable concludes  ""in a messier succession scenario, however, it becomes more difficult to predict the militarys actions.""","a cnn analysis of secret cables published by wikileaks reveals american . frustration. u.s. has concerns over economic reform, mubaraks lack of succession planning. cables also reveal washington sees egypt as an important and    until now    stable ally.

" cnn     no play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. and no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call.  ""we are  not just robots they send out there,"" umpire tim mcclelland   nd from l  told author bruce weber.  yet these figures    the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment    are vastly different in importance to the average fan.  there are countless children who dream of becoming a major league pitcher. he is, literally, the king of the hill.  umpires  almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire.  and yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books  ""as they see 'em""  scribner , by new york times writer bruce weber, and ""the complete game""  knopf , by former major league pitcher  and current new york mets broadcaster  ron darling.  both jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game.  indeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers  jim boutons ""ball four,"" jim brosnans ""the long season,"" christy mathewsons ""pitching in a pinch"" , darling said he believes that people still do not  understand what it takes to stand on that mound.  ""within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'if pitchers were not  so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' "" he said in an email. ""of course, i knew this was a fallacy so i decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. throwing a ball   mph to tin cup sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and i wanted to express this to the reader.""  umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all    in fact, they are  often treated as less than human.  ""the owners basically see them like bases,"" former baseball commissioner fay vincent told weber. ""they say, 'we need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' ""  weber found a fraternity  and they are almost all men  much like cops or soldiers  tight lipped believers in baseball law and order.  weber immersed himself in the ""land of umpires,"" as the books subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing    including the legendary doug harvey, who was called ""god"" for his imperious demeanor. what he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule book knowledge and basic guts.  ""thats really what [being an umpire] is about    is being in charge,"" he said. ""if theres anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it is  that special kind of chutzpah.""  umpires need that presence because they are  often baseballs most disrespected men. aside from the vitriol they face    the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling ""kill the ump""    they are  second guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the   umpires' strike.  and yet major league baseball does not  participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire run private schools, weber observes.  mlb does run an annual umpire camp.   darling echoes webers concerns in his own field, pitching. in these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are ""undertrain[ed],"" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks ""never allowed to throw more than   pitches."" that leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says.  ""it would be like training for the marathon and never running more than   miles,"" he says. ""identifying and preserving million dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people.""  darlings book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. he talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for darling in a   game in which he got pasted by the cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a world series game and    in a treat for baseball fans    goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a   extra inning contest that darlings yale bulldogs lost to frank violas st. johns redmen,    .  he says he remembered the games vividly. ""i definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but i was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. a little scary and maybe a major personality flaw ""  pitchers get more support than umpires, of course. darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well pitched game ""is one of sports most beautiful dances. i would not have said it when i was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. you did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there.""  umpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. more common is to be vilified for missed calls. weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired don denkinger, a   year veteran remembered by fans  if hes remembered at all  for a wrong call in the   world series.  though time has dulled the pain, ""i think he lives with [that call] every day,"" weber said. ""when a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating.""  weber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. when watching games now, the yankees fan says, he will  focus on the umpires.  ""i just think umpiring is interesting. people hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but i do not ,"" he said. ""now i am  always interested who the umpires are.""  which is a point the umpires would appreciate.  ""umpires are people, too,"" veteran ump tim mcclelland told weber. ""we have families; we have emotions. ... somebody says, 'kill the umpire,' and people go, 'heh, heh, thats funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person.  ""we are  human. we are  not just robots they send out there.""","""as they see 'em"" is in depth look at baseball umpires. ""the complete game,"" by mets broadcaster ron darling, gets inside pitchers head. two positions have similarities  necessary command, some disrespect. "
"president barack obama signed an executive order monday banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  despite calls from religious leaders, faith based groups will not be exempt.  ""thanks to your passion and advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause, our government    a government of the people, by the people and for the people    will become just a little bit fairer,"" obama said.  gay federal workers are already protected from workplace discrimination by a clinton era order and obamas action extended the protections to shield workers from gender identity based discrimination.  americans united for separation of church and state, which joined a coalition of nearly   civil rights and lgbt groups urging obama to reject calls for a religious exemption, thanked him for taking action. it said he made the ""right call"" for not tagging any religious exemptions to the document.  ""faith based groups that tap the public purse should play by the same rules as everyone else and not expect special treatment,"" the groups executive director, rev. barry lynn, said in a statement. ""no forms of discrimination should be supported with the taxpayer dime, period.""  rea carey, executive director of the national gay and lesbian task force, was in the room as obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment.  ""there are now millions of lgbt people and their families who are just going to sleep a little bit easier tonight knowing that they ca not  be fired from their jobs as federal contractors,"" she said.  during the ceremony, which comes   years after president lyndon johnson signed the civil rights act of  , obama also recalled the history of executive actions and legislation to ban discrimination in the workplace and ""make sure we the people applies to all the people.""  senate passes lgbt anti discrimination bill  but obamas signature on monday did not touch a   executive order signed by president george w. bush that allows religious groups to weigh prospective employees' faith in hiring decisions.  this gave some opponents of the order hope that they could continue to consider sexual orientation in hiring decisions.  one of those opponents, stephen schneck, director of the institute for policy research   catholic studies at the catholic university of america, said he was disappointed by obamas decision regarding the religious exemption. but he suggested that religious groups could still rely on the   order.  ""i believe the administration has left open a path that religious groups can work with,"" schneck said.  russell moore, president of the ethics   religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention, had stronger words for obama and worried that the bush era executive order would leave out some faith based groups.  ""while we do not  know the full implications of this executive order, i am disappointed that this administration persistently violates the freedom of conscience for religious organizations that provide necessary relief for the poor and endangered,"" moore said. ""the ones hurt will be the most vulnerable in our society.""  obamas executive action extends protections against sexual based discrimination to employees of federal contractors operating outside of the   states and the district of columbia that enacted their own non discrimination legislation.  obama also noted that a majority of fortune   companies have policies in place against discrimination based on sexual orientation.  the action is not the first time obama has used his presidential powers to benefit the lgbt community. in  , he signed an order extending benefits to same sex partners of executive branch employees already provided to opposite sex partners.  but on the federal legislative level, lgbt groups have struggled to enact similar legislation.  the senate passed a bill barring lgbt discrimination in the fall. but the measure, which exempted religious groups from the would be law, did not make it to the house floor where republicans opposed it.  and attendees greeted obamas call to continue applying pressure to ""resolve this problem once and for all"" with one resounding word  ""amen.""  supreme court rules against obama in contraception case",executive order bars contractors covers lgbt employees; religious groups not exempt. it did not touch a previous order allowing religious groups to weigh faith in hiring decisions. opponents disappointed on decision involving religious groups.

"london, england  cnn     when danish auteur lars von trier presented his gothic thriller, ""antichrist"" at cannes film festival last month, it was greeted with cat calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter.  danish auteur lars von trier has been making films that shock, provoke and impress for over   years.  filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at cannes and the two hander starring willem dafoe and charlotte gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception.  but it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many.  von trier was labeled a woman hater for the wince inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead charlotte gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a diy clitoridectomy right to camera.  an ecumenical jury that normally hands out a prize at cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award ""antichrist"" an ""anti prize"" for being ""the most misogynist movie from the self proclaimed biggest director in the world.""  ""lars von trier, we get it,"" wrote film critic wendy ide in uk paper the times. ""you really, really do not  like women.""  misogyny could not  be further from the truth, according to von trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen  ""i mostly see myself as the female character,"" the   year old director told cnn in cannes. do you think that lars von trier is a woman hater  tell us below in the soundoff box  the director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness. indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von trier, who is famously multi phobic, would be able to make another film.  in the winter of  , he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital, the aftermath of which left him ""like a blank sheet of paper,"" he told danish paper politiken at the time.  today, if not fully recovered    the most terrifying thing he can think of is still ""myself""    he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues.  despite, or perhaps because of, what he describes as his ""sensitive"" nature, von trier is one of todays great contemporary european auteurs, considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of scandinavian filmmaking.  ""i think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it,"" said von trier. ""the good side is that you can sometimes achieve something creatively. but, of course, it always also allows some of these negative thoughts in.""  watch lars von trier talking to cnns the screening room about ""antichrist"" â»  he has been nominated for the top prize at cannes, the palme d'or, a staggering eight times, winning once in   for the harrowing operatic tragedy, ""dancer in the dark,"" starring icelandic musician, bjork, who also took home the best actress prize that year.  it is rumored bjork became so unhinged filming ""dancer in the dark"" she ate her own cardigan. von trier claimed each morning she would say ""mr von trier, i despise you,"" and spit at him.  in pictures  the wierd world of lars von trier â»  von trier has a reputation for being tough on his actors. his friend and long time collaborator, actor stellan skarsgard describes von trier as ""not uncomplex.""  ""i was scared,"" admitted gainsbourg who won best actress at cannes for her performance. ""i had heard stories about him as a director ... maybe hes cruel and vicious."" but she now describes him as her ""guide"" and ""the greatest director i have  ever worked with.""  fueled by his unconventional approach and upbringing, the mythology surrounding von trier looms large over everything he touches.  brought up in copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying. each visit to cannes involves a five day road trip from denmark to the french riviera by camper van.  he has an undeniable egotistical streak  this year at cannes, he declared, ""i am the best filmmaker in the world,"" and in  , when displeased that cannes jury president roman polanski had only awarded ""europa"" the runner up grand prix prize, he called him a ""dwarf.""  he also seems to actively court controversy    palme d'or contender ""dogme     the idiots"" grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non simulated sex on screen, and for von triers typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude.  but, von trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates. he says he finds it difficult to know how to satisfy the needs of others with his films and so works only for himself.  ""i feel very strongly for satisfying, maybe not my own needs, but my own idea of the film and the images that come from within,"" he told cnn.  ""if i did not  follow my instinct, then i ca not  work.""","pornographic sex and visceral violence in ""antichrist"" shocked early audiences. von trier was accused of misogyny but claims to identify with the female character. ""antichrist"" stars charlotte gainsbourg and willem dafoe as a bereaved couple. von triers ""the idiots""     was first mainstream film to show non simulated sex. "

""the result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return    nothing political, but more of a survival instinct. what needs not to be spelt out for film makers venturing north is that one plays according to what goes with the territory.""  the new chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of hong kong made films, says film archivist cheng.  ""today production is down, with many majors like chinastar and golden harvest scaling back,"" he says. ""most films are high end productions with big stars, or low end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return.  ""the number of screens is also down, with the consolidation of more multiplexes, usually owned or partly owned by distributors, which already have a steady supply of foreign films to fill the screens. some once video distributors like mei ah and universe have gone into production as a way to keep the pipeline flowing.""  in  , hong kong closed five small cinemas and re opened one multiplex. gary mak, director of broadway cinematheque    hong kongs last remaining alternative screening venue    remains optimistic about more adventurous programming and distribution. but mak points to a shortage of creativity in the local industry.  ""no talents, no formal training, in most areas such as script writing, directing, acting, etc,"" he says. ""even the independent scene still needs more real talents    or at least, real producers to pull together a really good project.""  tim youngs, hong kong consultant for italys far east film festival, says changing tastes among hong kong movie goers has also affected the industry.  ""audiences have become increasingly dismissive of local movies, often referring to them as poor quality, and there are much fewer paying cinemagoers these days.  ""so the hometown audience shows less support for local movies, whether by not seeing local films or opting for piracy, while the declining number of films means less opportunities for film makers, fewer chances to try out new things, and damage to confidence.""  elizabeth kerr, film critic and curator formerly based in seoul, south korea, agrees with youngs' assessment.  ""for all the risk taking businessmen out there [in hong kong], no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is and throw in some support.  ""the industry for the most part suffers from the cleave between that fluff    which makes money    and the more adult film making of the smaller studios, distributors and indies.""  how is south koreas film industry different from its hong kong counterpart  ""the drive to attain world adoration,"" kerr says. ""koreans truly believe they are  making great art all the time. south korea launched an active campaign on all levels    corporate, government, education    to train and cultivate a modern film industry.""  still, kerr sees reason for optimism. films that best retain a hong kong style, kerr maintains, likely carry ""category iii""  under   not allowed  ratings  movies that are ""grown up and smart,"" she says.  ""even if the films do not  work, someone tried.""  in the end, it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for hong kongs movie industry.  ""around  , like lots of hong kong people, i kind of lost myself,"" says independent film maker chan wing chiu. ""the film industry was already almost dead in the ' s. why work for a sunset industry ""  chans own first feature in  , ""a side, b side, sea side,"" includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on hong kongs cheung chau island who are unable to communicate in chinese with an australian man speaking fluent mandarin. the two parties end up conversing in english.  ""thats me,"" says chan, referring to the girls. ""i speak english better than putonghua [chinas official common language, also known as mandarin]. many chinese say that now that hong kong is part of china, hong kong people must learn putonghua. i disagree. in hong kong we all speak cantonese. hong kong already has a bad reputation for putonghua, but i do not  feel ashamed. i am  proud to have grown up during the transition between   and sar.  ""why do we have so many problems with china  because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different. so we are not good at speaking putonghua. even in the cinema, we see western movies, japanese movies, korean movies... but not many chinese movies.""  adds independent director yan yan mak  ""we are monsters. china says  'you are not chinese.' gweilos [hong kong slang for caucasians] say  'you are chinese.' after  , we lost the confidence to be hong kong people."" email to a friend",hong kong film production has dropped almost   percent since early  s. mainland investment and market influences quality of hong kong films. problems include few opportunities for new talents and little audience support.

" cnn     the phenomenal success of ""modern family"" has been a game changer for its entire cast, including actor jesse tyler ferguson.  the shows high ratings, three consecutive emmy wins for outstanding comedy series and broad fan base have given all its stars a massive platform. ferguson is using his for a cause thats both political and personal  the fight to legalize same sex marriage.  the   year old montana native does not  just play mitch, a gay man in a loving, committed relationship on tv; in a way, he is mitch. after dating for more than two years, ferguson and his boyfriend, justin mikita, decided to take the next step. during a recent trip to mexico, ferguson ""popped the big q."" mikita said yes.  after much consideration and debate, the newly engaged couple decided to go public with their private news, not because they do not  enjoy their privacy    they certainly do    but because in doing so they knew they could shine a light on a cause dear to their hearts.  ferguson and mitka started the tie the knot foundation. its mission is simple  sell bow ties to raise money for marriage equality. the ""modern family"" actor recently spoke with cnn about his organization.  cnn  when you go to www.tietheknot.org, the first thing you see is a hilarious video of you and justin announcing your engagement.  jesse tyler fergusson  i feel like when you tackle any subject with comedy, humor and wits, you are  going to get a lot further than if you just give the dry facts of the cause.  cnn  it definitely gets your attention. it could not  have been an easy decision to put your private life out there like that.  ferguson  we kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged. it made me very nervous; i did not  want to exploit something that was very personal and private between justin and me. but, in the context of our foundation, it felt like  it was  the right time to tell people.  cnn  my favorite part was your struggle with labeling your relationship.  ferguson  i hate ""lover""  i think it sounds so pretentious and like that ""saturday night live"" skit with will ferrell and rachel dratch in the hot tub eating turkey. i have  always found the term fiance in gay or straight relationships to be completely strange. it does not  sound english or american at all. i love calling justin ""the lover i have  taken on,"" but he does not  care for that. so i just say ""boyfriend."" i think theres something really sweet and innocent about it.  cnn  a lot of boyfriends, and girlfriends in maine, maryland and washington got some good news on election day when same sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote.  ferguson  i have such mixed feelings about it. obviously, i am  so happy these states won marriage equality. it is  also very tough for me. i went through it with proposition    in california , seeing the majority vote on the minoritys rights. it is  incredibly hard to swallow. i just feel like it should not  be up to the majority to vote on a minoritys civil rights.  i am  thrilled that we are slowly making progress, and we have to make progress however we can. but i do look forward to the day we stop putting it in the hands of the states and make it a national thing. this is america and  marriage equality  should be part of the ""united"" part of our country.  cnn  what do you see as the biggest challenge between where things are now and the protection of same sex marriage under federal law   ferguson  we are  in a great place. theres a forward movement on this issue, and for many young americans it is  a nonissue. but one stumbling block is the lack of education about marriage equality.  i feel like theres a fear that the definition of marriage will be changed. nobodys looking to change the meaning of what it means to be married. we just want to add to who has the right. it is  the same thing as women wanting the right to vote. they were not  going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot; they just wanted the right to vote.  cnn  and whether you are  voting or getting married, who does not  like to wear a nice bow tie, right  why did you pick this accessory as the cornerstone of your foundation   ferguson  i selfishly wanted to get involved in the fashion world anyway, but in a way that did not  feel like a huge undertaking. so i thought about what i like to wear and also what is literally the smallest piece of clothing i could possibly design. so we came up with the bow tie line. it was justins idea to incorporate it into the foundation. we thought    why do not  we kill two birds with one stone  we will  start a bow tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality. then justin came up with the idea of tie the knot, which just perfectly marries those two ideas.  cnn  i think people will appreciate the symbolism. also, it matches your character in ""modern family."" i imagine your cast mates have been supportive. the chemistry there really seems to go beyond the set. is that the case   ferguson  i mean it really is. people are always trying to test us and break us and find out the darkness, but theres really nothing to tell. we are  kind of on this roller coaster together, and it is  a very bonding experience.  we are  watching our families grow. i have  gotten engaged since meeting these people. ty  burell  has had two kids. julie  bowen  had twins. sofia  vergara  got engaged. we will  go to a birthday party or get together at someones house and bring our husbands, wives, fiances, boyfriends and girlfriends, and it feels like a huge extended family.  cnn  i bet when one of your family members finds themselves at the center of a crazy headline or serious crisis you all react. do you turn into papa bear   ferguson  theres obviously some sense of protection because we know being  in  the medias eye how vulnerable that can be when you are  going through something. so we all rally around one another and protect one another. we are  always checking in with one another, and some walls definitely go up to protect some people. it is  exactly what you would expect from people who have your back.  cnn  i can only imagine what a ""modern family"" gay wedding will be like. i bet you and justin get asked a lot when the big day is.  ferguson  about once a day  we are  in the process of planning it. it could be as early as this spring, and it could be the following spring. we are  kind of waiting for some pieces to fall into place and to see what my work schedule is like next summer. i am  also really excited to be married. i do not  want to have a three year engagement. i proposed to justin because i wanted to be married. i do not  want to be a professional engaged person.  cnn  are you planning something more traditional or, dare i say, modern   ferguson  well, we are  not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony. i grew up catholic but do not  practice any longer. i have not  been to the catholic church in years so i would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions    it is  just not us. it is  going to be a very nontraditional, very organic, very simple ceremony. we are  not going to have a wedding party or try to find someone amazing to officiate. i think it will be a very short, very sweet and simple and hopefully beautiful ceremony. i do not  even have any gay friends who have gotten married, but several of my straight friends had very untraditional weddings, and those have always been my favorite.  cnn  have you decided about starting a family   ferguson  it is  something we have  talked about. it is  one of those early date questions. ""do you want kids "" and we both do. but i am  just excited to get married and sit in the marriage place for a little while. i do not  want to jump into kids right away. but, yeah, we both really want kids very much.",jesse tyler ferguson and justin mikita launched tie the knot foundation. proceeds from the organization go toward the fight to legalize same sex marriage. ferguson said he is protective of their relationship.

"ten years ago i was one of a small number of uk lawyers who opposed the invasion of iraq on the grounds that it was illegal and unauthorised by the united nations. we were all strong advocates of the notion that the rule of law was the bedrock of any civilised and democratic society. without it our lives would be subject to a free for all in which might becomes right.  the embodiment of the rule of law internationally has been the united nations . charter and the universal declaration of human rights    direct results of the devastation inflicted by the nazi regime in germany during the second world war. no one wanted a repeat of such flagrant aggression, so the charter was drawn up to replace gunboat diplomacy with peaceful measures overseen by the united nations . security council.  this was not a new vision. in   the united nations . charter was ratified by the american ., the uk, and the majority of the   states who had originally agreed to this framework. thrashed out by experts and with massive support behind it, the document was no maverick, outlandish or oddball agreement. the charter is not gobbledygook    it is full of common sense, and it should be obligatory reading in every school.  opinion  why iraq war was fought for oil  article   makes clear that the main purpose of the united nations . is to ""maintain international peace and security and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace"" and to act in accordance with justice and the principles of international law.  it is for the united nations . to determine what collective measures should be taken    not for individual states to take unilateral or bilateral action. this is not rocket science, but the simple application of restraint and respect for the rules that britain and america agreed to when they signed the charter.  but this is not what happened   years ago at the behest of american . president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair. their agenda was quite different    to remove a dictator, saddam hussein, whose regime was abhorrent.  but regime change, however desirable, is not permitted by the charter. if it were, the powerful nations could go round the world picking off the weak    or more particularly the states thought to be hostile to their own ambitions.  in case some politicians found it difficult to understand all this, article      spelled it out in unequivocal terms  ""all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state"".  everyone recognised there might have to be exceptions to this rule, but the charter specifically does not authorize preemptive nor preventative action i.e. getting in first  on the basis of a perceived future threat.  interactive  how has the war changed you   the only way around this predicament was for the bush blair axis to fabricate a case of threat. this they did by the knowing manipulation of flawed intelligence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq  which were never found , and the bogus claim that saddam hussein could deploy such wmd within a   minute window.  this argument, which was false, became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law. the united nations . has the power to authorise military intervention once all other options have been exhausted and the peace and stability of a region is in jeopardy. at the time it became a debate about whether iraq satisfied these criteria by its failure to abide by united nations . resolutions concerning disarmament.  the principal security council resolution  , adopted in november  , called on iraq to disarm its wmd and cooperate with united nations . weapons inspectors. the council made clear they continued to be in charge but had not authorised the use of force in iraq.  exclusive  hans blix on 'terrible mistake' in iraq  tony blair insisted to the british public that he would only support a war if a second security council resolution authorising the action was passed, but the resolution never came. bush and blair realised they would never get one, and so they prepared to go it alone with a cobbled together coalition. troops had already been committed on the ground. there was no going back.  this was why bush and blair were not prepared to allow the weapons inspectors, who were in iraq, any more time. inspectors had found no evidence of wmd in the lead up to the war and never did, but were ordered to go home.  i am not alone in these views. there is a substantial consensus of international legal opinion which recognises the illegality of the invasion. kofi annan, then the united nations . secretary general, told the bbc in   that the charter had been breached and that the invasion was not sanctioned by the security council.  full coverage  the iraq war,   years on  in the uk we are still waiting for the results of a public inquiry into the circumstances in which the decision to go to war was taken. blair never wanted this inquiry but was forced by the power of the victims' families and public opinion to accede. so far two years have gone by while the government has obstructed disclosure and publication. it is intolerable and inexcusable.  i believe george w. bush and tony blair should be tried for war crimes as defined by international law.  in   the international criminal court was established to deal with individuals who commit international crimes. four transgressions were agreed    war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. unfortunately only the first three have been brought into effect. the uk, to their credit, signed up to the court. but the american . did not, lest its leaders end up accused of crimes before the court.  arwa damon  iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow  whilst the act of aggression cannot be prosecuted, war crimes committed thereafter can be. so for example to launch an attack, like the invasion of iraq, with the knowledge that its effect is likely to cause incidental death or injury to civilians or the natural environment  article    will render the perpetrator liable to prosecution. the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium in iraq by coalition forces  euphemistically called collateral damage  upon vulnerable civilians falls within this definition. as a result, a legal consortium of which i was a part, and other groups in europe, petitioned the icc for action against uk politicians over their involvement in the war. nothing has happened.  getting american  leaders hauled before the court is even more problematic    the security council could refer americans to the court, but the american . is a permanent council member and can veto any potential referral.  alternatively individual member states could incorporate these crimes of universal jurisdiction into their own domestic law. then if a american . perpetrator of war crimes travelled into that countrys jurisdiction, they could be arrested.  the uk has such a provision, but when put to the test by uk citizens seeking arrest warrants in relation to the planned visits of israeli political and military leaders    who were potentially responsible for war crimes in gaza    the uk government reprehensibly placed impediments in the way of its future use. so george w. bush can safely plan a visit for tea with tony blair in london without fear of prosecution in the uk.  the whole episode regarding the iraq war is a tawdry tale that has subverted the rule of law and tarnished the reputation of international law.  without accountability for western states, how can we expect the rest of world to respect these principles  it is time for bush and blair to be thoroughly, independently and judicially investigated for the crimes i suggest have been committed and it is time for the crime of aggression to come into force.  until this is redressed, la lotta continua ","mansfield  bush, blair should be tried for war crimes over invasion of iraq. mansfied  regime change is not permitted by the united nations . charter. mansfield  charter does not authorize preemptive action based on perceived threat.

particular, was a frenzy of activity as medical workers sifted through rubble there. wafa claimed that israeli fighter jets struck that mosque and another, killing at least three people.  less than a mile away from the qassam mosque, a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike, palestinian health ministry spokesman dr. ashraf el qedra said. israels military confirmed the strike, saying the two men were militants.  el qedra added saturday night that a   year old girl died in an airstrike on her family home in rafah. that was in addition to a   year old boy who died while playing with friends, the palestinian health ministry said.  then again, israel is on the defensive as well.  the israel defense forces said that, since the end of the cease fire early friday, about   rockets were fired toward israel from gaza.  that figure includes at least   launched saturday, of which   hit israel, the military said.  the idf responded by targeting ""some   terror sites and nine terror operatives.""  all this back and forth, of course, is nothing new.  the israelis and palestinians    particularly hamas, the islamic militant group and political party that controls gaza    have been at it for weeks, with the former fending off persistent rocket attacks and the latter dealing with relentless israeli strikes.  there have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it. and there have been some breakthroughs, including a few cease fires.  yet none of those peacemaking attempts, so far, has stuck.  death tolls rise slows  the death tolls climb has slowed since idf announced overnight into saturday an end of its ground incursion in gaza    even as it continued to strike from the air. israeli forces say troops redeployed after completed their mission of destroying hamas' tunnels.  still, while there were not  scores of dead saturday as has been true many other days over the past few weeks, the total carnage remains significant.  according to el qedra, at least  ,  in gaza have died since the conflict began, in addition to just under  ,  injured.  it is  unclear how many casualties were militants  the united nations estimates that about    of the dead were civilians, or about  , . idf, meanwhile says about   militants have been killed, which would put the civilian death toll at around  , .  idf spokesman lt. col. peter lerner said that that number was a preliminary estimate based on field reports from troops returning from battle.  israeli officials say   israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in israel. the iron dome missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets gazan militants have fired at populated areas of the country.  blame game continues  besides the violence, another thing that has not  stopped is the blame game.  one point of contention  who broke the most recent cease fire hours before it was supposed to run out   hamas denied firing rockets into israel on friday.  yet militants from islamic jihad and the al nasser salah al din brigades admitted to doing just that    blaming israel for refusing to accept their demands during negotiations.  israeli government spokesman mark regev said it was hamas' fault regardless, telling cnn the group runs gaza and ""ca not  outsource terrorism to the other groups. when they want to enforce a cease fire, they do it very well.""  hamas has been in charge of the palestinian government in gaza for years, while the palestinian faction fatah runs the government in the west bank. the two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government, including one earlier this year.  one sad irony of all this bloodshed is that    according to the egyptian foreign ministry, which brokered recent talks    the parties have reached an agreement on most issues. those not agreed upon were few and limited, the ministry said in a statement.  still, theres too much history to show that agreement on some issues will not necessarily lead to a grander breakthrough.  the palestinians have asked for israel to lift its blockade on gaza and to re open the air and seaports, a palestinian negotiation who spoke on condition of anonymity said. israeli authorities fear hamas could import weapons by sea and maintains a ship blockade off gazas shores.  palestinians also wanted israel to extend gazas fishing zone in the mediterranean from three miles off the coast to  . fishing is a keystone of gazan livelihoods. but israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast, said hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri.  yet israel is resisting in depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory.  after gazan rocket fire on friday, israels foreign ministry said the country ""will not conduct negotiations while under fire.""  cnn exclusive  inside the mind of hamas' political leader  nobel laureate wiesel  hamas must stop using

"washington  cnn     the sister of presidential assailant john hinckley jr. testified tuesday that she has seen no sign that her brother represents a danger to himself or others.  diane sims, who said she loves her brother, said she supports a proposal that would expand his visits to their mothers home in williamsburg, virginia, and might eventually allow him to live there as a full time outpatient.  but she said she does not think it would be a good option for him to move to the dallas area, where she lives.  ""president bush lives not   minutes from me and i think it would be a concern,"" said sims, apparently referring to concerns the secret service might have. former president george w. bush and his wife, laura, moved to dallas after they left the white house.  sims said she has no worries that hinckley would be a risk to others in dallas. american . district judge paul friedman asked if it is accurate she is worried about her brothers personal safety in dallas, since that is the city where president john f. kennedy was assassinated in  .  ""thats a concern to me,"" sims said quietly. she also said she thinks a move to dallas would place hinckley too far away from the medical experts who have cared for him for many years.  hinckleys sister testified on the fourth day of a multiple day hearing to discuss his future. hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the   shootings of president ronald reagan, press secretary james brady, secret service agent timothy mccarthy, and police officer thomas delahanty. all of those men survived, though brady was shot in the head and left permanently disabled.  hinckley was staying at the home of his sister and her husband in dallas on october  ,  , when, according to testimony in his   trial, he went to a pawn shop to buy two .  caliber revolvers, one of which he used to shoot reagan and the others five months later.  only days before the purchase, three guns had been confiscated from hinckleys luggage while he was trying to board a plane in nashville. hinckley posted bond, was released and flew to new york city, then spent the night in new haven, connecticut, where actress jodie foster was a college freshman student.  he flew to dallas to stay that weekend at his sisters home while she and her husband were away at a football game. on that monday, hinckley told her he was going out to look for a job, but, unknown to her, he bought the guns instead.  the gun purchase was not mentioned in court tuesday, and the government has not said it would be more dangerous for hinckley to live in dallas than anywhere else.  since his conviction, hinckley has been living in st. elizabeths, a government mental hospital in washington.  but in recent years hes been allowed to visit his mothers home with increasing frequency. currently, he spends   days a month in williamsburg. under the proposal made by st. elizabeths he would be granted two visits of   days each followed by six visits of   days.  the hospitals recommendation for hinckleys eventual release on convalescent leave asks the judge to allow hinckley to live full time in williamsburg ""at the discretion of the hospital"" once the eight longer visits have been completed successfully.  the report was filed with the court under seal on july   and was not made public until tuesday.  the doctors signing the report said such leave would be permitted only upon an assessment, at the end of the new visits, that ""mr. hinckley is experiencing a good mental status and that he does not present as [sic] a danger to himself or others.""  if so, the recommendation said, hinckley would be ""conditionally released to reside permanently on convalescent leave.""  he would be required to meet at least once a month with a psychiatrist who is already counseling him in williamsburg and to continue his weekly visits to a therapist there. he would also be expected to continue his volunteer activities at eastern state hospital.  however, the filing said, should hinckley violate the terms of his convalescent leave, ""the hospital will return him to total inpatient care with due notification of the court.""  if the judge were to grant convalescent leave at the hospitals discretion at the end of the eight longer visits now requested, it would be unlikely to happen until at least the fall of  , since as the filing requires a minimum two week interval between each of the new visits.  hinckley would be expected at the outset to live with his widowed mother, who is turning   this week and is in good health.  however, the hospital said should his ""mother not be available"" after hinckleys release, his brother and sister had expressed interest ""in the housing options of independent apartments as well as assisted living facilities... in the williamsburg area.""  sims often spends time in williamsburg when hinckley is there and drives him back to st. elizabeths.  she was asked many questions about how the   year old fits into the virginia community. she said he feels comfortable there and has indicated he wants to stay there even when his elderly mother is no longer there.  according to sims, hinckley likes working part time in the library of eastern state hospital and is comfortable with the psychiatrist and case manager/therapist he sees while in williamsburg.  under questioning, sims acknowledged the family does not permit a woman identified in court only as cb to visit the hinckley home. hinckley at one time told some of his caregivers at st. elizabeths that he was engaged to cb, who had been a patient there. hinckley later ended the engagement, doctors have said.  prosecutors described cb as being psychologically american table and asked if it was accurate hinckleys mother does not allow her to visit for fear she would have a mental breakdown at the home. sims said that is the case.  sims said her brother never told the family he was engaged and    quite to the contrary    has said hes not engaged and has no plans to marry the woman. she said she is aware her brother still sees cb sometimes when the woman visits st. elizabeths.  previously the court heard testimony that sims had taken her brother to a singles group meeting in williamsburg a number of years ago, and he was asked to leave.  sims said she wanted to set the record straight about what happened. she and her brother believed members of the group knew they were coming, but that was not the case, she said. the group was surprised to see hinckley there, she said. but she said all the members were in their mid  s and her brother would not have fit in.  sims said that when her brother goes out in the community he usually has no problems with people who recognize him. ""hes not bothered by people, hes not pointed out,"" she told the court. she said, ""he does not  bother anybody"" either.  she said hinckley and his family members find they are able to go to certain restaurants where people know who they are but are welcoming. ""in general, the people in town have been very tolerant,"" she said.  last week, prosecutors said hinckley had not told the truth about deviating from his approved itinerary to go to a movie while on his few hours of permitted unaccompanied time. according to a report by secret service agents who were watching hinckley without his knowledge, on one outing last july, hinckley did not attend a movie and instead went to a bookstore where he passed by an aisle of books that included an account of the day reagan was shot.  the judge noted the report did not indicate that hinckley read that book or any similar books.  ""the subject was not observed picking up and looking at specific books,"" the report says. ""one item of note is the subject stopped for a time and looked at the shelves in the american history area that contain several books about president reagan and his attempted assassination.""  hinckleys sister said she had accompanied him to bookstores and never saw him look at any books like that. she said he gravitated to books on music and art. but in response to questioning by a prosecutor, she said she was not  aware hinckley had failed to go to the movies as planned on two occasions, in july and in september.  sims was asked if she ever noticed secret service agents keeping an eye on hinckley. she replied the only time she has noticed surveillance is when she drives hinckley out of her mothers gated community and back to st. elizabeths. she said agents are always waiting in a vehicle and follow along.  but at the end of a march   visit, the secret service was not waiting, she said. according to sims, about midway through the trip to washington, hinckleys brother, scott, got a call on his cell phone from an agent who said he had been late. sims said the agent asked the hinckley familys location and requested that they wait for him to catch up.  sims replied the family did and was happy to cooperate with the secret service.  cnns james polk contributed to this report.",new  hospital staff makes release recommendations. john hinckleys sister says she supports letting him eventually live in williamsburg. she says he feels comfortable there and is accepted by many community members. hinckley has been hospitalized since he shot president reagan in  .

""iraq, afghanistan and parts of pakistan pose unique challenges for our country,"" bush said tuesday in a speech at the national defense university in washington.

""over the next several months, we will bring home about  ,  combat support forces    including aviation personnel, explosive ordnance teams, combat and construction engineers, military police and logistical support forces,"" he said. ""by november, we will bring home a marine battalion that is now serving in anbar province. and in february of  , another army combat brigade will come home.  ""this amounts to about  ,  additional american troops returning home without replacement. and if the progress in iraq continues to hold, gen. petraeus and our military leaders believe additional reductions will be possible in the first half of  .""  at present, there are about  ,  american . troops in iraq.  an adviser to iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki welcomed bushs decision.

""more significant troop reductions in iraq are needed so that we can start to rebuild american . military readiness and provide the additional forces needed to finish the fight in afghanistan.""  skelton said iraq ""cannot continue to overshadow other critical american . security needs.""  ""the effort in afghanistan must move to the forefront and once again become our top priority,"" he said.  democratic presidential nominee sen. barack obama praised bush for announcing additional troops for afghanistan and ""moving in the direction of the policy that i have advocated for years.""  however, ""we will continue to spend    billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a    billion surplus,"" obama said.  ""in the absence of a timetable to remove our combat brigades, we will continue to give iraqs leaders a blank check instead of pressing them to reconcile their differences,"" he said.  obama criticized the timing and scope of bushs move.  ""his plan comes up short    it is not enough troops, and not enough resources, with not enough urgency,"" the senator from illinois said of bushs call for more troops in afghanistan.  in his speech, bush praised other members of the american . led coalition, saying many of those nations will be able to end their deployments to iraq this year. he said australia has ""withdrawn its battle group"" and polish troops are ""set to redeploy shortly.""  the president said iraq and the united states will work ""toward the conclusion of a strategic framework agreement and a status of forces agreement,"" pacts that will spell out the terms of their relationship.  ""these agreements will serve as the foundation for americas continued security support to iraq once the united nations resolution authorizing the multinational forces there expires on december  .""  bush focused his remarks just as strongly on afghanistan, where al qaeda and taliban militants have been making a comeback.  ""for all the good work we have done in that country, it is clear we must do even more,"" he said. ""as we learned in iraq, the best way to restore the confidence of the people is to restore basic security    and that requires more troops.""  he said that a marine battalion of around  ,  will deploy to afghanistan in november instead of iraq and that an army combat brigade of around  ,  will go in january.  bush said the american . would make additional forces available in   and called on allies to increase their force levels.  bush said stepped up insurgent efforts in afghanistan have necessitated the increase of american . troops from ""less than  ,  two years ago to nearly  ,  today.""  he said these troop increases and those by allies, including britain, france, poland, bulgaria, romania, australia, germany, denmark and the czech republic, have resulted in what he calls a ""quiet surge"" in afghanistan.  bush described challenges in afghanistan that do not  exist in iraq.  ""this is a vast country,"" he said. ""unlike iraq, it has few natural resources and has an underdeveloped infrastructure. its democratic institutions are fragile. and its enemies are some of the most hardened terrorists and extremists in the world.""  he said americans will help develop afghan security forces and are improving efforts on the civilian side, adding more personnel to deal with issues of diplomacy, development, the rural economy and the fight against the drug trade.","new  sen. barack obama, house armed services chairman criticize scope, timing. new  iraq views decision as ""positive move,"" aide to iraqi leader says. iraq force to be trimmed by  , ; afghanistan force to rise by  , . president bush cites increased stability in iraq, stronger insurgency in afghanistan.

""mr. ballmer has insisted, as a provision of this deal, shelly sterling get approval from the court that she has the authority as the sole trustee based upon the removal of mr. sterling as a trustee. so we are here because mr. ballmer is insisting that the court bless the transaction,"" streisand said.  ""if it does not go forward, the consequences are dire,"" streisand said.

""to date, i have not received donalds written consent to the sale of the clippers to  ballmer  for    billion,"" shelly sterling said in court papers.  sterling has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend v. stiviano surfaced. the recording included a series of racist comments.  sterlings comments, first posted on tmz, sparked outrage among nba players, executives and fans. the commissioner fined sterling   .  million and banned him for life from the nba.  in a statement tuesday, sterling said he has apologized for the remarks and his apology is sincere.  he also made inflammatory comments to cnns ""anderson cooper  "" about african americans, which the nba had planned to use as part of its evidence against him in an owners' meeting where a vote would be taken on whether to terminate his ownership rights. the meeting was canceled.  sterlings lawsuit makes clear that he believes the nba has no right to force such a sale, and the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him.  in addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks a restraining order.  sterling says nba officials are 'bullies,' 'hypocrites,' 'monsters'  nba commissioner  sterling saga not over yet","donald sterling shows 'neurodementia of the alzheimers type,' a doctor says. hes unaware of the season and ca not  spell 'world' backward, doctor adds. he shows 'early alzheimers disease' or other brain disease, second doctor says. findings are consistent with 'the general loss of brain tissue,' third doctor says.

" cnn     ah, fandom, it is  a curious and wonderful thing. when it was announced last year that we would be getting a green day version of ""rock band,"" fans of the band  myself included  were pretty excited.  the band that helped turn the ' s punk rock revival into a more mainstream, pop radio movement would be getting some major attention in the digital world.  when the game was released on tuesday, i could not  wait to get home and see if i could play like tre cool or sing like billie joe armstrong.  but with so many other versions of ""rock band"" out there, why would you want to spend money on this game   well, for starters, any fanboy or fangirl will love the loading screens with green day specific graphics and sounds. you also get to view cool memorabilia, like still photos and rare video footage of the band, for completing songs in career mode.  playing songs like ""when i come around"" and ""pulling teeth"" brings back memories of college days, and yes, i will admit i wish they had put ""all by myself"" in the game, because it is  the only hidden track that green day has ever included on an album. maybe an easter egg is hiding in the shadows for us to discover   there are also unique drum lessons written specifically for this version of the game. from what i have  seen, even veteran rock band players will need them.  most of the songs included in the game are ones that fans of green day can listen to again and again. now we can also tell our friends, ""yeah, i five starred 'brain stew/jaded ' ""  hardcore ""rock band"" fans have posted videos on youtube of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars, which is something that not even the members of green day were able to do, according to a recent interview with mtv.  the graphics are really well done in this game and the motion capture technique used to animate the green day doppelganger is pretty impressive. when the piano opening to ""viva la gloria  little girl "" starts playing, billie joe encourages the audience to clap and fakes surprise when the piano stops before the song kicks into high gear. it is  almost like being at a concert    i nearly forgot i was supposed to start singing.  also notable is that the bands clothing choices match the theme and era of each album.

" cnn     former american . sen. arlen specter, who embodied a vanishing breed of liberal republicanism before switching to the democratic party at the twilight of his political career, died sunday after a long battle with cancer, his family announced.  specter died of complications from non hodgkins lymphoma at his home in philadelphia, his family said. he was  .  the veteran pennsylvania politician had overcome numerous serious illnesses over the past two decades, including a brain tumor. he had been in the public eye since serving as a member of the warren commission, which investigated the assassination of president john f. kennedy.  specter was elected to the senate in   and represented pennsylvania for   years, longer than anyone in the states history. his politically moderate image fit hand in glove in the politically blue northeast, both with its democratic centrists and its liberal republicans.  he was also one of americas most prominent jewish politicians, a rare republican in a category dominated by democrats over the decades. and his name is synonymous with pennsylvania, an idiosyncratic state that pushes and pulls between the two parties, and his home, the staunchly democratic city of philadelphia.  in  , philadelphia magazine called him ""one of the few true wild cards of washington politics ... reviled by those on both the right and the left.""  ""charming and churlish, brilliant and pedantic, he can be fiercely independent, entertainingly eccentric and simply maddening,"" the profile read.  former gov. ed rendell, a democrat, called specter ""a mentor, colleague and a political institution"" who ""did more for the people of pennsylvania over his more than   year career with the possible exception of benjamin franklin."" and pat toomey, the republican who now holds specters old senate seat, praised him as ""a man of sharp intelligence and dogged determination.""  and at the white house, president barack obama said specter ""was always a fighter.""  ""from his days stamping out corruption as a prosecutor in philadelphia to his three decades of service in the senate, arlen was fiercely independent    never putting party or ideology ahead of the people he was chosen to serve,"" obama said in a written statement on specters death.  and vice president joe biden lamented the loss of ""my friend,"" ""who never walked away from his principles and was at his best when they were challenged."" biden will travel to penn valley, pennsylvania, on tuesday for specters funeral, according to the white house.  g. terry madonna, director of the franklin   marshall college poll and professor of pubic affairs at franklin   marshall college, said frank sinatras song ""my way"" could apply to specter.  ""there is not  any doubt in many respects he was an unusual politician,"" madonna said. ""he did not  look at polls. he did not  track how his comments were playing out in the press. ...  ""he was fundamentally a pragmatist who could bend with the times,"" madonna said, and he believed greatly that government could help people.  ""the republicanism in his day, it was a different kind of republican. he was a philadelphian, and not into that staunchly conservative republicanism that we see"" today.  readers wished the best for specter  madonna called specter an ""indefatigable"" public figure, highly demanding of both himself and those who worked for him over the years. he had a few election losses but he was undeterred by defeat, the prospects of losing and the challenges he faced.  ""the last thing you would have thought about arlen specter was that he was born in kansas,"" madonna said. ""he always came across as kind of urbane. he had a kind of caustic sense of humor.""  but specter in fact was born in wichita, the youngest child of lillie shanin and harry specter, an immigrant from ukraine. he grew up in russell, kansas, also the hometown of another republican icon, a one time presidential nominee and senator, bob dole.  after graduating from russell high school in  , specter first went to the university of oklahoma. but he eventually went east for his higher education. he earned a bachelors degree in international relations in   from the university of pennsylvania, in philadelphia, where he graduated phi beta kappa.  he was in the american . air force during the korean war from   to  , serving as a second lieutenant in the air force office of special investigations. he returned to his studies and graduated from yale law school in  .  after yale, he started practicing law and became an assistant district attorney in philadelphia.  he served on the warren commission at the recommendation of rep. gerald ford, later president. specter is credited with co authoring the ""single bullet theory,"" which suggested that some of the wounds to kennedy and then texas gov. john connally were caused by the same bullet.  even though he was a registered democrat, specter ran successfully for philadelphia district attorney on the republican ticket in   and eventually registered as a republican. he lost an election for philadelphia mayor in  .  he served as district attorney until   and prosecuted corruption cases against philadelphia magistrates and teamsters.  specter ran for the american . senate in  , but he was defeated in the republican primary by john heinz. he ran for governor but was defeated by dick thornburgh in the primary.  but he won his bid for senate in   and distinguished himself, serving until  .  ""during his tenure in the senate, specter championed pennsylvanias economy and took an active interest in foreign affairs, meeting with dozens of world leaders as well as supporting appropriations to fight the global hiv/aids pandemic and backing free trade agreements between the american . and under developed countries,"" according to a bio from the university of pennsylvania law school.  he served on the senate judiciary committee, of which he was chairman from   to  . he served as chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence from   to  . and he was a senior member of the senate appropriations committee.  specter brought more financial resources to pennsylvania than anyone in the state, working with mayors and other local leaders to help them get grants and aid, madonna said. and hes remembered across the states   counties for his efforts.  ""he did not  shy away from pork,"" madonna said.  he participated in the confirmation hearings of   american . supreme court nominees, the penn bio says. he is remembered for leading the charge against conservative nominee robert bork and going after anita hill, who accused nominee clarence thomas of harassment.  ""no member of congress shaped the supreme court more than he did,"" madonna said. ""he had a prosecutorial mindset. he could be incredibly persuasive as an interrogator.""  specter straddled right and left. he criticized republicans for president bill clintons impeachment and voted in favor of the iraq war. he supported embryonic stem cell research.  during the  s, he briefly announced a run for president but eventually dropped the effort and endorsed bob dole.  despite his longtime membership in the republican party, specter became more alienated from the party as it grew more conservative.  like many of his moderate compatriots, he came to be viewed by the new conservatives as a rino    a republican in name only. decades after he switched to the republican party, he changed his stripes again. he became a democrat in  , saying republicans had moved too far to the right and embraced social conservatism.  the move gave democrats a   seat filibuster proof majority in the senate. but in  , when he ran for re election, specter lost the democratic primary to rep. joe sestak.  sestak, who went on to lose the race to toomey, praised specter via twitter as ""a warrior of inestimable public service.""  after the loss, specter moved from the halls of congress to those of academia, taking on a new role at the university of pennsylvania law school as an adjunct professor.  ""arlens knowledge of the inner workings of the government and lawmaking is second to none,"" said michael fitts, the law schools dean. ""the insight he brings from his career in public service, particularly as a leader on judicial issues, will be invaluable to our students as they prepare for their own careers in the law.""  the senator practiced law when he was not  in office and authored books throughout his career, including      ""passion for truth  from finding jfks single bullet to questioning anita hill to impeaching clinton""     ""never give in  battling cancer in the senate""     ""life among the cannibals  a political career, a tea party uprising, and the end of governing as we know it""  ""for the past quarter century, hes also been a zelig like national figure,"" the philadelphia magazine article said, referring to the woody allen character from the film of the same name who changed his persona as his surroundings and circumstances changed.  ""from his role in sinking robert borks supreme court nomination to his cross examination of anita hill, from stem cell research to the impeachment of bill clinton, specters greatest talent may be his unique ability to put himself    somehow, some way    in the center of the nations most important debates,"" the article said.  obituaries    the lives they have  lived  cnns sarah hoye in philadelphia contributed to this report.","new  vice president joe biden praises ""my friend,"" plans to attend funeral tuesday. specter died of complications from non hodgkins lymphoma. he represented pennsylvania in the senate longer than anyone else. he was long one of the most prominent jewish american politicians.

""really, we are  just waiting,"" said evie bertaut, who has lived in morgan city for   years.  officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding, but some are taking preliminary precautions, she said. at sacred heart church, where bertaut works, people spent the day moving important documents such a baptismal, marriage and financial records to the second floor.  ""most people are getting their photographs together, things that you ca not  replace in case you have to go,"" she said.  a collective gasp as louisiana town braces for flood  meanwhile, in the arkansas town of helena, the river crested at  .  feet     .  feet above flood stage, according to the national weather service.  the rivers slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare, forecasters said. but while the slow moving water gives residents extra time to get ready, it also means that land could remain under water for some time.  jindal urged southeastern louisiana residents to evacuate.  ""now is the time to take action,"" he said.  the american . coast guard said floodwaters could close the mississippi river to ships at the new orleans port as early as monday morning.  to help new orleans, the army corps of engineers said friday that it will open   more bays at the bonnet carre spillway just north of the city, diverting water into lake pontchartrain. that will mean a total of   bays will be open in the   bay spillway.  stars talk about the flooding and response  the national weather service said that as of friday morning, the river was at  .  feet in new orleans, just a fraction below flood stage. it is expected to crest may   at more than   feet. the new orleans levees are built to withstand   feet, according to the weather service.  upriver in vicksburg, mississippi, police chief walter armstrong said   residents had been evacuated as of thursday night. the river was expected to crest at  .  feet. flood stage at vicksburg, the level at which the river may begin flowing over its banks, is   feet.  armstrong said he expected higher water friday, with more homes affected. more than two dozen roads were closed and about   businesses will be closed by friday.  homes that were built between the levee and the mississippi river were the first affected.  ""we estimate that every home built on the river side of the levee from memphis all the way to the louisiana line is flooded,"" said mike womack, executive director of the mississippi emergency management agency.  residents near vicksburg counted on a levee for protection. in addition to the mainline levee along the river, starting near vicksburg and extending northeast for more than   miles, a so called backwater levee offers shelter.  the backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the yazoo river delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it. that level is expected to be reached monday, said charlie tindall, attorney for the board of mississippi levee commissioners.  the backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, he said.  nonetheless,  .  million acres in mississippi, including  ,  acres where crops are growing, could flood, said rickey grey of the states department of agriculture.  across the south and lower midwest, floodwaters have covered about   million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said.  in arkansas, the farm bureau estimated that damage to the states agriculture could top more than    million as more than   million acres of cropland are under water.  womack talks about flood costs  ""it is  in about   feet of water,"" dyersburg, tennessee, farmer jimmy moody said of his   acres of winter wheat, which was to be harvested in the coming month.  other farmers in mississippi, missouri, tennessee and arkansas rushed to salvage what wheat they could ahead of the rising water. as for corn, farmers who were able to get into the fields during a soggy planting season in late march and april are seeing their crops in some cases under several feet of water.  some officials said thursday that spillover effects resulting from the flood could threaten other industries. that includes the possibility that the waterford   nuclear power plant in taft, louisiana, could be closed, according to cnn affiliate wgno.  the mississippi river is expected to crest at  .  feet in taft on may  . if it reaches   feet, officials told wgno, the plants water intake system could shut down.  nbas grizzlies inspired by fans in flooded memphis  carl rhode of entergy, the plants operator, told wgno that the threat to the intake system is not a matter of nuclear safety.  however, scott welchel, a st. charles parish emergency operations center official, said shutting down the plant would have a ""domino effect"" on local industries.  ""it would impact every industry along the river,"" welchel said. ""thats just something that is not  easy for people to deal with, especially on a moments notice.""  for residents in communities along the river, the damage has been far more devastating than can be measured in dollars and cents.  danny moore of millington, tennessee, told cnn affiliate wpty that the recent disaster marked the second time in one year that flooding took away nearly everything he had.  moore said that after a flood destroyed all of his furniture last year, he decided to move everything he owned into rented storage space. however, those belongings were destroyed when his storage unit was flooded several days ago.  ""they say bad luck comes in threes. i hope this is the end of it,"" moore told wpty.  the millington resident said he lost a house to a fire in  . moore said he is too preoccupied with taking care of his girlfriend, who is suffering from an infection that is damaging her liver, to look for new furniture.

" cnn     the chinese french painter zao wou ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words. faced with this challenge, ""it is  easier to learn english "" he joked, his wit shining through, even though alzheimers disease had already begun its slow, relentless onslaught on his mind.  zao, widely regarded as one of the foremost chinese contemporary painters of the  th century, passed away at his home in switzerland on tuesday at the age of  .  born in beijing in  , he formed part of the second generation of chinese artists to turn westward in their search for inspiration. encouraged by the french educated chinese artist lin fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious hangzhou national college of art  today the china academy of art , he relocated to paris in  . although he did not know it at the time, the move would be permanent, due in part to the rapidly changing political situation in china.  apart from brief trips abroad, zao would remain in france until the year before his death, one of the few chinese artists from his generation to emigrate to europe. embraced by france, he was elected to the prestigious academie des beaux arts society in   and received the legion of honor in   from then president jacques chirac.  for zao and his contemporaries, paris represented the source of modern art. living there meant direct access to the paintings that he had until then only encountered as black and white reproductions in art magazines. an oil painter by vocation, he immersed himself in the riches that surrounded him    heading directly to the louvre on the very day he arrived in the city.  meanwhile, with the assistance of his friend and mentor, noted poet and painter henri michaux, and blessed with the warm charm and wit that would impress me decades later, zao cultivated an extensive circle of fellow artists and cultural figures. in just a few years, he established himself as an integral member of the postwar french art world.  zao worked hard to find his artistic voice. at first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting    the medium most closely associated with the chinese painting tradition   and subject matter that might be construed as overtly chinese. he wished to be appreciated on his own merits and not to fall victim to stereotype.  his breakthrough, however, came with his   masterpiece ""wind,"" a painting that was both his first purely abstract work and a return to his origins  the inky black forms rising in two wavering columns are abstractions of oracle bone characters    the most ancient of chinese scripts.  in the decades that followed, zao committed himself fully to abstract painting, rarely using even figurative titles after  . instead, he titled his works with their date of completion, marking their entry into the world. the lyrical qualities that defined him as an artist appeared early on, first in his oil paintings and later in his ink paintings, after his reengagement with the medium in the early  s  oscillating planes of color, light, and shade met, collided, and diverged, skidding across the surface of his works.  the apparent disorder of his paintings concealed an underlying structure, sometimes described as daoist in nature, which bore striking parallels to a similar balance between order and chaos found in chinese traditional painting. in zaos case, this phenomenon is perhaps best understood as a self statement  the artists insistence on his personal and aesthetic identity in the face of the vagaries of borders and time.  zaos given name, ""wou ki""  or ""wuji"" in the standard hanyu pinyin romanization used in china , means ""no boundaries."" no single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of france and china.  ""french thought and chinese thought are not the same,"" he told me. ""it is  hard to translate between them. sometimes you must wear yourself out trying to understand. painting must express these feelings.""  an artist friend once asked about my research. hearing that i studied zao wou ki, he grew suddenly pensive. ""zao wou ki,"" he mused, ""his work is not  representative of either chinese or french art."" ""yes,"" i answered. ""he represents himself, and that is enough.""","chinese french painter zao wou ki died tuesday at age  . zao was regarded as one of foremost chinese contemporary painters of the  th century. zao was uniquely able to combine cultures, aesthetic visions of france and china in his work.

"kenyan counterterrorism sources are looking at a norwegian citizen of somali descent as a possible suspect in the westgate mall attack last month, the sources told cnn on friday.  the norwegian citizen is believed to have ties to mohamed abdikadir mohamed, known as ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the somali terror group al shabaab.  norwegian intelligence services are in kenya investigating ikrima and the norwegian citizen, the kenyan sources said, and have also spoken to the latters sister in norway.  norwegian authorities have not yet released the norwegian citizens name.  kenyan authorities suspect ikrima of involvement with the westgate mall attack.  al shabaab claimed responsibility for the bloody four day siege at the american cale mall in nairobi, where at least   people died.  u.s. officials said ikrima was the target of a raid earlier this month by american . navy seals on an al shabaab compound near the town of baraawe in somalia. it is  believed that he escaped after the american . troops came under heavy fire.  a kenyan intelligence dossier seen by cnn alleges ikrimas involvement with briton samantha lewthwaite, a terror suspect known as the ""white widow,"" in a foiled mombasa attack in   with jermaine grant, a fellow british citizen currently held in mombasa on terror charges.  kenyan intelligence sources say that ikrima, who speaks six languages and grew up in kenya, is the main ""point person"" between al qaeda in somalia and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula, and that he has helped pinpoint kenyan targets.  recruiting operatives in the west   morten storm, a former informant who has worked for several western intelligence agencies, has told cnn that he developed a close relationship with an al shabaab figure called ikrima between   and  . he said he is confident that it is  the same person who was targeted by american . forces.  inside story on an al shabaab commander  storm, who is danish, described ikrima as a somali kenyan al shabaab operative who had spent time in norway. he said that ikrima made clear to him via email that he was ready to send recruits from the west back home from somalia to launch attacks.  norwegian journalist bent skjaerstad told cnn his sources have confirmed that ikrima had indeed spent time in norway and had tried to recruit for al shabaab in europe. skjaerstad, who reports on security and terrorism for tv , said ikrima had lived there between   and  . he had failed to gain asylum status but had been given norwegian travel papers.  skjaerstad told cnn that according to his sources, ikrima had traveled to somalia while living in norway and had used about a dozen aliases.  friends of ikrima who knew him from his time growing up on the nairobi suburb of eastleigh told cnn he traveled to norway in   and grew increasingly radicalized there.  the sources, who had kept up with him over the years, said ikrima traveled in   to london, where they lost contact with him. in   they heard that he was in somalia, where he has been based since.  arabic is among the six languages spoken by ikrima, and he studied french for two years at the alliance francais in nairobi, his friends say.  al shabaab in norway  the possible involvement of the norwegian citizen in the westgate mall attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of the al shabaab group outside somali borders.  stig hansen, a security expert based in norway and author of the book ""al shabaab in somalia,"" told cnn that if the norwegian suspect is who he believes him to be, he lived in a small town in norway but had connections with a wider group, not all of somali origin.  he came to norway at age   or   and stayed for a couple of years, during which time he gained norwegian citizenship, hansen said. he later returned to somalia.  al shabaab became quite popular among some somali community groups in norway from   to  , hansen said, ""because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group.""  observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its english  and arabic language messaging, he said, which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature.  ""but the terrorist attacks inside of somalia made it easier for the wider ethnic somali community to see that this was really a terrorist organization, and it distanced itself,"" he said, making it less popular now.  however, this development brought its own problems, hansen said, and not just in norway.

" cnn     a top judge has issued a special plea to the four suspects named in the killing of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri killing to come before the court.  judge antonio cassese, the president of the special tribunal for lebanon, said in an open letter to the four men accused in the   attack that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or even participate in the trial proceedings without being present.  cassese issued the statement after lebanese authorities told him they have been unable so far to serve warrants on and arrest the accused.  ""we will conduct trials based on a firm presumption of innocence of the accused. the tribunal shall never convict anybody unless guilt is established beyond any reasonable doubt,"" he said.  arrest warrants were issued for salim jamil ayyash, mustafa amine badreddine, hussein hassan oneissi, and assad hassan sabra.  a highly placed source in the lebanese army, who had correctly given cnn the names of the suspects previously, has said that all four belong to hezbollah, the lebanese shiite militant group.  hariri, a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician, died when his motorcade was hit by a bomb in beirut on february  ,  .  supporters say he was killed because of his opposition to syrian influence in lebanon. his death prompted mass protests that led to the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon, who had been in the country for nearly   years.  cassese defended the tribunal, saying its personnel ""are doing their job with full independence and impartiality.""

" cnn     it is  a moment familiar to any regular air traveler.  a passengers photo shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling on mondays continental flight  .  the plane bucks up and down, lurches forward and back, or both. sometimes overhead bins fly open. the squeamish gasp. babies cry. then, usually, it is  all over.  in flight turbulence is often a mere inconvenience. but it is  also the leading cause of airline passenger injuries that are not associated with a fatal crash, experts say.  and, on rare occasions, it can be deadly.  in the case of mondays continental flight  , an unexpected blast of air led to much more than jangled nerves, bumps and bruises.  turbulence struck the flight, from rio de janeiro, brazil, to houston, texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to miami, florida.  police said   passengers were injured, four seriously.  learn more about airline turbulence â»  turbulence, according to the federal aviation administration, is caused by a quick change in air movement. jet streams, air shooting off of mountains, cold or warm weather fronts and thunderstorms can all cause changes in speed or direction.  the rapid shift in gravity force    or g force    can cause a sensation not unlike being whipped around on a roller coaster. most of the time, discomfort is the worst byproduct.  ""normally, it is  an inconvenience,"" said kevin garrison, a retired delta air lines pilot living in lexington, kentucky. ""very rarely does it hurt passengers, which is odd because a lot of them do not  keep their seat belts on.""  and wearing seat belts, aviation officials say, is the best way to stay safe.  ""in the event that something happens,"" said les dorr, a spokesman for the faa, ""thats the best advice that we or anyone else can give passengers.""  since  , three people have been killed in turbulence related accidents, according to the administration. at least two of those deaths involved passengers who reportedly were not wearing seat belts while the seat belt sign was on.  there have been   turbulence related accidents since  , and   passengers were seriously injured in those accidents, the faa reported.  flight attendants have been hurt at a much higher rate. during that same time period,   attendants were seriously injured, despite their numbers being far smaller than the number of passengers.  ""the majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants,"" dorr said. ""they have to be up performing their tasks, even when the seat belt light is on.""  and while pilots are almost always strapped in with seat belts, even they are not  exempt.  ""i have  had a few bloodied heads    when i hit my head on the overhead when the seat belt was a little loose,"" said garrison, who flew for delta for   years.  in mondays accident, passengers reported they were slammed into the boeing  s ceiling    some said two or more times    when the plane dropped rapidly.  ""i saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls,"" fabio ottolini, who was returning to houston with his wife and daughter after visiting family in brazil, told cnn affiliate ktrk tv.  passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts.  initial reports are that the monday flight was hit by what is  called clear air turbulence, or air pockets that hit without warning.  while pilots are always on the lookout for regular turbulence spots    like mountain ranges and places where weather fronts are converging    clear air turbulence can happen anywhere.  ""you ca not  see it; you ca not  sense it with radar,"" dorr said. ""the best way to determine if theres a possibility of clear air turbulence is to have somebody in front of you thats already flown through it.""  dorr said passenger injury numbers have dropped over the past few years, during an industry wide effort to increase safety.  no passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in  , and five flight attendants    down from a high of   in      received serious injuries, according to the faa.  the commercial aviation safety team has focused on seat belt awareness and pushed for better communication systems for reporting turbulence, dorr said.  all licensed pilots also receive ""upset training,"" which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.","three turbulence related deaths since  , faa says. at least two of the three were people not wearing seat belts. turbulence is caused by quick changes in air movement. air pockets from ""clear air"" turbulence are hard to detect.

" cnn     for decades, skyscrapers have served as iconic symbols of national pride or flashy trophies of corporate wealth, reshaping the skyline of the worlds major urban centers. perhaps in the future, the high rise superstructures could also help revolutionize the way we travel.  that, at least, is the fanciful concept behind the vertical hyper speed train hub, a futuristic proposal of two uk based architects envisaging trains roaring up and down the side of specially designed skyscrapers nearly as high as the empire state building.  towering above the crowded streets of future metropolises, these giant buildings are designed to minimize the large slices of real estate that major railway terminals occupy by flipping them on their side.  the goal, designers christopher christophi and lucas mazarrasa say, is to free up valuable space in the densely packed cities of tomorrow, which will be significantly challenged by overcrowding and a sharp drop in public space availability.  ""in   years' time, it will be very difficult for governments to find attractive pieces of available land for public use in the heart of megacities,"" says christophi,  . ""governments will be able to take advantage of such spaces in order to re adapt the cities' structure to society needs,"" he adds.  how it works  the designers vertical station concept calls for a tall cylindrical skyscraper whose small footprint would allow the transformation of the surrounding area into an urban park. passengers arriving at the tower would use a lift to make their way up into the platform and from there into their carriage, which could accommodate   people sat in two rows opposite each other.  but, you might wonder by now, how could commuters stay on their feet whilst the train slides in hyper speeds along the huge towers faãâ§ade   the main idea is that instead of traveling on normal rails beneath, the carriages would be supported by magnetic tracks running up the skyscrapers exterior. each carriage proportion is designed as a cubical shape to enable it to function both vertically, when docked, and horizontally, while traveling after the trains departure, the wagons would pivot like a ""ferris wheel,"" allowing commuters to remain in an upright position and enjoy breathtaking views of the city.  connecting cities  the radical proposal won the designers an honorable mention at this years evolo skyscraper competition, which encouraged people from around the world to propose new ideas for vertical structures of the future.  the designers say the towers, which would be capped off by a rooftop green plaza, are envisioned as individual pieces of infrastructure that could be replicated in cities around the world.  the hope is to connect a new hyper speed network of underground tunnels and overground routes where superfast trains would cover distances of   miles in   minutes. this, they claim, would not only save commuting time and simplify the way public transport is being used, but would also help to cut down co  emissions by replacing ways of transport powered by fossil fuels.  ""our conceptual design is based upon utilizing existing and viable technologies that can currently be seen in hyper speed rail networks, for example in china,"" says mazarrasa,  , adding that is a matter of time before we are  able to reach the rail speeds their concept requires.  ""the maglev trains currently travel at   miles per hour    this technology by the   will in no doubt move leaps and bounds from what it already is today, making the hyper speed trains probably the fastest and safest way of transporting goods and people.""  of course, there are a number of limitations to the project    the proposal deals only with stations designed to accommodate city by city travel, not to mention efficiency issues around loading trains in high volume terminals and connecting train routes.  yet, like in most futuristic transport proposals, practical details are best to take a back seat for now to allow us to enjoy the thrilling ride    that is, unless you are  afraid of heights.",a futuristic proposal flips the traditional designs of todays major train stations vertically. the vertical hyper speed train hub wants to cut the footprint of rail terminals by  . the proposal won an honorable mention in  s evolo skyscraper competition.

"new york  cnn     in a recent piece by prominent iranian cartoonist mana neyestani, we see one of his favorite characters    a cantankerous grandfather who along with his two grandchildren is a solid supporter of the green movement against the regime in iran    having managed to tie up larry king inside a closet and trying to disguise himself as the world renowned talk show host in order to get to interview mahmoud ahmadinejad.  sporting his thick moustache and holding a list of tough questions in hand, the grandfather is charging out of the closet yelling at a cnn producer, ""get out of my way  the language of this mr. president only i understand,"" while the producer is baffled by the thick moustache that ""larry king"" has suddenly grown.  the point of the cartoon is a deep and pervasive sense of frustration that iranians all over the world have with the inability of prominent american journalists and talk show hosts to handle the slippery ahmadinejad. christiane amanpour, charlie rose, and larry king in particular are being criticized for providing ahmadinejad with a global forum to say whatever nonsense he wishes without enough of a serious challenge to his statements    some of which are flat out lies.  since the massively contested presidential election of june  , scores of peaceful demonstrators have been arbitrarily arrested, tortured, and murdered; prominent human and womens rights activists, reformists, and labor union leaders have been arrested and subjected to stalinist show trials and given long and punishing prison terms; the leaders of the opposition green movement have been systematically harassed and intimidated; the universities have gone through yet another round of ideological purges; yet another cultural revolution to silence and suppress non conformist ideas is well under way; an entire cadre of independent minded journalists have been forced into the indignity of exile    and yet few of these atrocities manages to gain much attention in the conversations that these prominent american journalists have with ahmadinejad.  that sense of frustration is not limited to iranians. jon leyne, the distinguished senior bbc correspondent has written a wonderful essay discussing the difficulties of interviewing ahmadinejad. mr. leyne points out how ahmadinejad succeeds ""in moving the agenda onto a ground of his own choosing, and few, if any, of the western journalists who have interviewed him have scored many points off him.""  the former usa today correspondent barbara slavin has also written an article, ""how not to get played by ahmadinejad,"" in which she too testifies that the ""iranian president has perfected the art of slipping and sliding around even the most seasoned interviewers.""  perhaps the best example of how ahmadinejad manages to slip away from hard questions is when christiane amanpour asked him about the case of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani, a woman charged with murder and adultery and originally condemned to death by stoning.  in response to amanpours question, ahmadinejad point blank said that this report is false and ashtiani has not been condemned to death by stoning    which was a plain lie.  in anticipation of ahmadinejads trip to new york, the international campaign for human rights in iran had in fact prepared a full preparatory list of atrocities perpetrated under the administration of ahmadinejads for american journalists    with key facts and crucial issues that they might raise when interviewing him.  to be sure, amanpour did ask ahmadinejad about executions increasing fourfold since he took office, as well as about the iranian regime taking action against opposition leaders, including raiding their offices. and in larry kings case, after interviewing ahmadinejad he had a follow up conversation with fareed zakaria, the host of cnns ""fareed zakaria gps,"" in which the evasive answers of ahmadinejad were put in proper context with more detailed attention to the internal atrocities in iran. but still the balance of the result tipped heavily in favor of ahmadinejads rhetorical one upmanship.  slavin has suggested that ""reporters need to be armed with in depth knowledge of irans economy, politics and society    and even then, they may have difficulty getting ahmadinejad to admit the truth."" but that is not the modus operandi of a journalistic culture that is conceptually geared towards geopolitics and ""international"" politics rather than domestic matters.  ahmadinejad always wins in these encounters because he points to other atrocities by redirecting the question at the questioner, and there are plenty of atrocities around the globe.  the other factor is the language barrier between ahmadinejad and his interviewers, which he strategically uses to his advantage. ""mr. ahmadinejads technique,"" leyne points out ""is aided by the fact that most of the foreign interviews are carried out in translation    leaving the journalist less scope for jumping in, and less time to cross examine.""  leynes young colleague, bahman kalbasi of bbc persian has now become a facebook phenomenon because he accosted ahmadinejad in a hallway at the un and shouted a succession of questions at him  ""mr. ahmadinejad why do not  you talk to iranian journalists  why do you just talk to foreign journalists  why do you run away from iranian journalists ""  ahmadinejad left his real surprise for after all his interviews, when during his official address to the general assembly he effectively accused the united states government of direct involvement in the atrocities of  / . but in this case, president obama had an opportunity during his subsequent interview with kalbasi to respond to ahmadinejad.  ""for him to make the statement here in manhattan,"" president obama said, ""just a little north of ground zero, where families lost their loved ones, people of all faiths, all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation, for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable,"" obama said.  still, too many of ahmadinejads statements went unchallenged last week   particularly those that had to do with the vast array of atrocities in his own country. these are not problems that can be solved by handing to journalists a list of questions to ask a head of state with just too many skeletons in his closet to count. these are problems that american journalism as an institution faces as it tries to cope with and cover a far more globalized planet than we have  ever seen before.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of hamid dabashi.","mahmoud ahmadinejad presides over regime that commits atrocities, says hamid dabashi. he says american television interviewers are not  sufficiently challenging in their questions. dabashi says ahmadinejad lied in denying iranian woman was sentenced to stoning.

" cnn     attention white anglo saxon protestants  your days of running things are over. you have jumped the shark.  but theres no need to feel bad for wasps.  they have  had an amazing run. every single president in our nations history, except for john f. kennedy    a catholic    and barack obama, has been a white protestant. except for a handful of exceptions, for over   years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been wasps. wasps had almost as many victories in a row as the harlem globetrotters.  but it is  over. look at this years presidential tickets  a mormon, an african american, and two catholics. even some of the keynote speakers at the democratic and republican conventions were not wasps. the gop featured italian irish catholic chris christie and the democrats tapped latino american, julian castro.  times are so bleak for wasps that theres not a single one on the supreme court. likewise, in congress, the percentage of protestants fell from   percent in   to a slim majority of   percent today. neither the current speaker of the house  john boehner  catholic  nor the senate majority leader  harry reid  mormon  is wasp.  i am  sincerely not gloating. and my jibes are in jest. but what i am  happy about is that our two major political parties are increasingly reflecting the new face of america. the demographics of our nation are changing and, by  , minorities are expected to become the majority in the american .  objectively, the delegates at this years democratic convention were far more diverse. the republican convention looked more like the early bird dinner crowd at the cracker barrel.  opinion  in ohio, candidates are salesmen trying to close the deal  however, in the gops defense, a party that is    white, they have started to slowly showcase minorities, such as sen. marco rubio and govs. nikki haley and bobby jindal. they are well aware that if they do not , the gop will go the way of the whigs.  theres little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates. and we will likely see in the not too distant future a president who is latino, asian, jewish, sikh or muslim.  that screaming sound you might have heard was michele bachmann shrieking in horror at the idea of a muslim american president.   this is a testament to our nation. we are by our very nature progressive. it may take years, or even decades, to see change, but we always march forward, not back.  so, how did we get to where we are today where the white protestant establishment seems to be losing power  well, it is  kind of complicated  as these things tend to be . there are tons of reasons. but one important factor that has contributed to todays political landscape is changing voting rights laws.  back in the days when our nation was founded, only white men who owned land could vote. that means rich white men with money get to control the political system.  i know some of you are thinking  how is that different than today    in our first presidential election in  , no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither catholics nor jews, were permitted to vote.  over time, some states abandoned the requirement of land ownership so that poor white men could vote. and the religious restrictions were also lifted so that non protestants were able to vote.  opinion  democrats and republicans need a plan to keep american dream alive  however, it was not  until after  , when the  th amendment was ratified, that black american citizens were finally guaranteed the right to vote.  although poll taxes, literacy laws and other measures were still employed in some states to disenfranchise black voters.   and it took all the way to      more than   years after our first president was elected    that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the  th amendment to our constitution.  enfranchising voters of all backgrounds has led to the opening up of our democratic process. minorities no longer just voted    they became active in politics. and they did not  just show up at political meetings    over time they sought elective offices. and some of them won. with each success, they inspire even more minorities of every race, ethnicity and religion to become active in our political system.  so wasps, you have  had your great run. and there is no doubt that another white protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the white house. but until that day comes, you can console yourself knowing that a white protestant male is one of the most exciting athletes in our nation today  tim tebow.  of course, he is the back up to mark sanchez.   the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah.","every president except for jfk and barack obama has been a white protestant. dean obeidallah  wasps have had an amazing run, but times have changed. he says political parties are increasingly reflecting the

" cnn     in january  , a hardcore ""transformers"" fan going by ""gaastra"" on a message board for shout  factory  a dvd and cd company ""for the discerning pop culture geek""  asked the simple question, ""what would it take to get the takara shows a release in america ""  before long, shout  factory dvd producer brian ward was asking fans how much interest they would have in such a release and what they would like to see on it.    months later, the first of the ""takara shows,"" known as ""transformers  headmasters,"" was officially released tuesday for the first time in the united states.  such is the relationship that geek friendly companies like shout  have with fans that this release has seen the light of day.  ""i am  really excited about it,"" said michael albert of bear, delaware, moderator of seibertron.com, a ""transformers"" community site that boasts as many as  ,  page views per day  mostly by fans whose interest in ""robots in disguise"" goes well beyond one of the biggest box office successes of the year, ""transformers  dark of the moon,"" and its predecessors . ""this is the first time we have  gotten a legitimate release of this japanese series. you would have to get recordings of them burned onto dvds, or import them from australia or europe, or find a laser disc player from the  s to watch this.""  albert and others from seibertron.com    one of many fan sites like tfarchive.com, tformers.com and tfw .com    said that these releases were one of the most sought after items by fans over the years.  the transformers first became a pop cultural phenomenon in the american . in the mid ' s, based on a pair of toy lines from japans takara company, microman and diaclone. when interest in the characters faded after a very short lived fourth season of the original ""g "" animated series, it came full circle with the japanese producing ""headmasters,"" the first in a series of anime which took the characters in a wild new direction, involving new characters who were able to detach their heads, which were entirely separate characters  the american . series only touched on this concept briefly before it ended .  ""it really is interesting to see just how the japanese and their culture played into a series that for most of us we have  only known as straightforward autobots vs decepticons,"" said ward, a ""transformers"" fan himself who has produced all of the shout  factory releases of other series, such as ""g "" and the  s ""transformers  beast wars.""  ""[the takara anime series] really bends towards a lot of things that japanese children want to see,"" said albert. ""after 'headmasters' is over, the transformers are not so much sentient robots but having human drivers. from what i understand, japanese children prefer having human drivers.""  ward pointed out other, more subtle culture differences. ""where the g  characters would call optimus prime 'optimus'    they were pretty casual with their leader    the japanese approach it very differently. optimus prime will be referred in more of a formal manner, he will  be 'commander' or something among those lines.""  ""the autobots and decepticons [in these series] are, no pun intended a well ordered machine,"" he said. ""it is  interesting to watch those characters change culturally.""  ""some major characters die early on,"" said matt brown of canton, michigan, a podcaster at seibertron.com. ""later in the series, another major character bites the dust. they do not  mess around.""  as with any anime import, there is the eternal debate of ""subbed versus dubbed."" there are some fans who simply do not want to watch subtitles.  kim manning, head programmer for adult swim  which is owned by time warner, also owner of cnn , and one of the top people responsible for what anime series are seen in the united states, said that every effort is made to get dubbed versions.  ""i think they are  more likely to reach a more mainstream audience, and we are  always hoping to get a larger audience excited about anime,"" she said. ""i think hearing it in your native language allows you to get more absorbed in the action, and to pay more attention to the animation, which is often just gorgeous.""  in the case of ""headmasters"" however, the episodes are not dubbed, but have brand new subtitles.  ""we saw the releases that had come out in the u.k. and australia and saw that the subtitles there were not  entirely accurate, and in some cases did not  make sense,"" said ward. ""it was clear that the folks who had translated did not use english as their first language. we gave it to a really good captioning and subtitling house in l.a. and they did a brilliant job of accurately translating the dialogue and understanding what was being said. we got those scripts approved by hasbro  owners of 'transformers' , and we are  really happy with the outcome. the translation is about as close as one can get to an accurate translation of what is  being said in japanese.""  dubbed versions of the series are out there, however, including one for malaysian and singapore television. ""when we heard them, it really got to a point where it was comical,"" ward explaned. ""the voices were awful. names would change. soundwave disappears and is simply replaced by 'new soundwave.' it was almost the equivalent of watching a saturday afternoon martial arts movie dub, and thats certainly not something we wanted to do with a property as beloved as 'transformers,' so we opted out of original dubs and went for brand new subtitles.""  early fan reaction to this was not entirely positive. ""there was a small bit of disappointment that the project could not  secure enough funding to do a brand new english dub,"" said seibertron.com podcaster bob king of ashley, pennsylvania. ""i kind of share that feeling, but i also know that this is not  going to be a very mainstream release, and for them to spend that much money would be kind of a gamble. i appreciate that they are  staying cautious.""  ""people who have not seen it before might be disappointed in the subtitles, but rest assured [that the existing dubs] are that horrible,"" said seibertron.com founder ryan yzquierdo, from chicago, illinois. ""you ca not  actually sit there and watch the dubs, unless you like drinking while watching 'transformers.'""  albert said that the takara series' legacy extends beyond a mere curiosity  ""the themes are non western compared to what hasbro does now but some of the design aesthetics do play into what we see today.""  the other takara series will be released in the near future as ""the japanese collection,"" though a production delay has postponed its release for several weeks.  despite those delays and some early hesitation from the subtitle phobic, yzquierdo said that most fans are just excited to check the shows out  ""this is something that i never thought i would see released in the states.""  indeed, this is just the latest example of fans communicating directly with companies to make a difference in what material is released to the public. manning has communicated often with a ""vibrant"" community of fans on the adult swim message boards.

""between   and  , larry norman was the christian rock scenes answer to bob dylan, john lennon and mick jagger,"" said emmy nominated director david di sabatino, who takes a critical look at normans career and life in his documentary ""fallen angel  the outlaw larry norman.""  ""he set the standard. he created the space for others to exist. ... the vision he created for where christian rock music could go still resonates today.""  the documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early  .  norman hit the american . music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. his first solo album, ""upon this rock,"" came out in late  , after he left the band people  the san francisco bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a top   hit with a cover of the zombies' ""i love you.""  it was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti vietnam war protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at woodstock.  as many americans looked for answers, norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major label debut.  ""it was a pretty gutsy move to sing about jesus on his first record,"" younger brother charles norman said. ""to take a chance on mentioning jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step.""  "" 'upon this rock' was written to stand outside the christian culture,"" larry norman said in an interview with ccm magazine. ""my songs were not  written for christians. ... i was saying, 'i am  going to present the gospel, and i am  not going to say it like you want. this album is not for you.' ""  no small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream.  a national survey conducted by louis harris and associates in   found that rock 'n' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country. about   percent of adults said they disliked it, with only about   percent saying it was their favorite.  compare that with today, when nearly two thirds of those asked in a recent pew resource center poll said they listen to it.  being a rocker in the late  s was not  just flying in the face of a conservative christian music industry but mainstream america as well.  then there were the lyrics, especially on normans second solo effort,  s ""only visiting this planet."" there were no happy songs about going to heaven; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day.  norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and jesus    sometimes in the same song    getting his music banned from christian bookstores that might have sold it.

""when i first became a christian, i hunted around in vain to find christian rock 'n' roll music i could relate to. it just all sounded horrible,"" richard said on ""rockspell,"" a gospel music themed bbc television show he hosted in  , and on which norman appeared.  then he was introduced to normans music, ""and i just was overjoyed and thrilled, because suddenly i could relate ... and there seemed to be a christian who could do it as well, if not better, than the rest of us.""  black francis of the alternative rock group the pixies said norman has been a lifelong influence.  ""i listened to his records growing up, and saw him perform many times. in fact, i used to dress up like him; long blond hair with bangs, sort of a grown out british invasion look, with black jacket, black shirt, black pants and two tone black and white cheerleader shoes,"" francis said.  ""while larry is always referenced by his christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll. his respect for the arena of entertainment is what gave him his power as a performer.""  more than   versions of normans songs have been recorded by other artists, including non gospel acts as diverse as richard and francis, as well as sammy davis jr., petula clark and tennessee ernie ford.  christian music has come a long way in the   years since norman pioneered christian rock.  ""before larry norman, there was not any christian music industry,"" said shawn mcspadden, manager for switchfoot and the grammy award winning band third day.  but today is a different story, according to figures from the gospel music association. it says   million units of christian/gospel music sold in  , totaling nearly    million.

build a case against them.  struggling to make use of his findings, kennedy approached the writers of the superman radio serial. it was perfect timing. with the war over and the nazis no longer a

" cnn     on tuesday, a federal advisory panel, the national science advisory board for biosecurity, recommended that university scientists who have submitted articles on how to modify a flu virus to two very prestigious journals delete critical information from them before publishing. the papers describe how to alter bird flu virus to be more infectious and potentially nastier.  yes, this is same bird flu virus that, as it moved into pigs, was freaking us all out last year. if you had the detailed map of the viral changes needed, then either a terrorist or an amateur ""garage"" biologist operating without the right safeguards would have a very effective critter for killing you and me.  if there is one thing that scientists hate, it is any policy that restricts research in any way. scientists are taught that they need to be bold in asking questions and not let anything deter them from following their thinking wherever it leads, no matter how unpopular that might be. they are also taught the absolute necessity of making their claims public in reputable journals so that other scientists can subject them to the critical skepticism from which the truth ultimately emerges.  once in a long while, however, the price of the truth is simply too high to let scientists disclose their findings publicly. that is so when it comes to publishing detailed information about dangerous viruses and microbes.  we do not  have to hide the genetic map for a killer avian flu virus from all eyes. access to some who have clearance to see it should be possible. if that is done, then the truth will still be known about whether those making claims of being able to engineer the virus can actually do so.  to go further with potentially catastrophic data is to court trouble.  there are those who will say that the only way to fight terror is to adhere to those values that have proven crucial to the advance of science over the decades. the more we know, the worse for the terrorists.  unfortunately, that is no longer the world we live in. the ethics of inquiry need to adapt. handing the complete formula for making a nasty pandemic bug to any nut with access to the internet or a subscription to a scientific journal makes no sense in a world that has seen the use of anthrax and sarin as weapons of terror.  freedom is key to good science. freedom from terror is also key to good science. when they conflict, the latter is more important freedom than the former. journals and those who write for them ought to do all they can to try and ensure that most important freedom.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of arthur caplan.","for first time, a federal panel has advised that science journals censor flu study facts. the papers describe how to alter bird flu virus to be more potent, says arthur caplan. scientists generally hate policies that restrict research in any way, caplan says. caplan  sometimes risk is too high to let scientists openly disclose their findings.

""jerry is also happy he can now have visitation with long time friends with the prior approval of the probation department and will be able to continue to use the deck to his home to exercise, care for and supervise his dog, bo, when bo is in the yard,"" amendola said in his statement issued after mondays ruling.  sandusky has been under house arrest since december, when he was charged with sexually abusing young boys over a   year period. he has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  cleland has said he is aiming for a may   trial for sandusky.  on monday, the judge denied a prosecution request that jurors be selected from outside the county where the former coach is being prosecuted.  the allegations against sandusky led to the firing of penn states heralded head football coach joe paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer.  tim curley, penn states former athletic director, and gary schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged   sexual assault of a child. both of them have pleaded not guilty.  on monday an attorney requested that the perjury charge against curley be dropped, arguing that paternos death means prosecutors no longer have a required second witness to support the charge.  cnns jason carroll and mark norman contributed to this report.",new  sanduskys attorney says the family is happy about the ruling. a judge rules that jerry sandusky can see some of his grandchildren. the judge denies prosecutors request to require the former coach to stay indoors. tim curleys legal team asks that a perjury charge against him be dropped. 
"kurdish fighters defending the key syrian border city of kobani are dangerously outmatched as isis advances, a top united nations official said tuesday, calling for the international community to step in.

" cnn     announcement of a nintendo  ds handheld console is causing a collective ""eh"" among fans of the pioneering gaming company.  the new console hopes to entice the entry level gamer  i.e. kids  with a large catalog of games designed for the nintendo  ds and ds while appealing to parents with a low price point     . unlike its counterpart, the  ds does not have   d visual effects, nor can it be folded shut like other ds handheld consoles.  instead, the  ds remains flat and fixed, much like a tablet. the controls are similar to other nintendo handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the  ds unit.  while critics are split over whether this is a good idea for the company in the long term, fans in forums and social media are shaking their heads. some are asking why a  ds model is needed when   d can be turned off on the current console, while others are calling for nintendo executives' heads.  much of the confusion lies in the naming convention. while the nintendo ds can only play ds games, the  ds and  ds can play games designed for the ds or the  ds.  the problem arises because the games are clearly labeled for the ds or the  ds, but not for the  ds, and could have parents wondering, ""where are the  ds games ""  it was a similar problem when the wii u was announced and players could not  play wii u on wii systems. the names were not  distinct enough to create separation for a casual audience.  the move to a non  d environment for the handheld console is a welcome one to some fans. ""oh i am  so happy they are  creating a  ds,"" said  omglazerkittens on twitter. ""thats the whole reason i have not  bought one yet.""  nintendo, for its part, has said the new device is designed for young kids, despite having promotional videos with adults using it.  despite the nonplussed reaction from many older gamers, some fans understand the need for a device aimed at the young audience.  the new console may appeal to ""parents who want to buy their kids pokãâ©mon and a  ds at an affordable price,"" wrote haziq, a member of popular online video gaming forum neogaf. ""plus, the flat design kind of reminds me of a tablet. i would not  be surprised if this is nintendos way of directly competing with that market for small kids.""  the october   release for the nintendo  ds is the same day the company plans to launch the latest titles in the pokemon universe, ""pokemon x"" and ""pokemon y.""  but other gamers are not  so quick to accept the need for the new console or nintendos explanation.  ""to those who say the  ds is a kid friendly option, where does the inability to protect the screen with folding fall into that "" wrote  justinmcelroy on twitter.  twitter user  kellyherron  wonders whether nintendo is not happy with the  ds market anymore. ""feels like they are  saying, 'ok, so our novelty really is a gimmick. oops.' ""  but in explaining the need for the nintendo  ds, another neogaf member may have offered the most clear eyed assessment.  ""parents will be buying this for kids and thats the point, hence the price,"" wrote alpha ex. ""they are  aiming at kids wanting the new pokãâ©mon game and if parents can get it cheap, it will  sell over a more expensive  ds model.""

" cnn     mitchell johnson was in danger of becoming the forgotten man of australian cricket. shunned by the selectors after an alarming loss of form, he spent a year out of the test team as he struggled to overcome a foot injury.  but the   year old is back with a bang, having terrorized sri lankas batsmen to help the home side clinch a     series win in melbourne on friday.  the left arm paceman was named man of the match after claiming six wickets and scoring   not out as the tourists crumbled to defeat by an innings and   runs    sri lankas third worst reverse in the five day game.  johnson, only playing because of injuries to other bowlers, followed up his four wicket haul from sri lankas first innings   with a fiery spell that earned two more scalps and ended the tour of key batsman kumar sangakkara, who had scored  .  sangakkara, who on the opening day joined the elite club of players to have scored  ,  test runs, needs surgery on a broken finger after being hit on the gloves by johnson    who also gave wicketkeeper prasanna jayawardene a hairline thumb fracture in the first innings.  neither jayawardene nor bowler chanaka welegedara were able to bat due to injuries, and sri lanka collapsed to     all out in  .  overs. two wickets fell in johnsons opening over of the innings, one of them a run out.

"washington  cnn     new disclosures that the internal revenue service targeted liberals as well as conservatives in assessing applications for tax exempt status have reshaped perceptions of the scandal, shifting the focus away from republican claims of political villainy.  irs targeting included liberal groups  investigations by the fbi, congressional committees, the treasury inspector generals office and the irs continue, but mondays revelations bolstered assertions by agency officials and democrats that the problem was egregious mismanagement instead of intentional misconduct by the obama administration.  shifting polls contradict key deposition  house democratic leader nancy pelosi of california told cnn on tuesday that the priority now should be to ensure that laws and regulations prohibiting political groups from getting tax exempt status are properly enforced, regardless of whether organizations are on left or right.  ""these groups are in some ways giving the appearance that their primary purpose is the common good, the common welfare ... when they are actively engaged in political activity, for which they should not  be getting a tax deduction,"" pelosi said.  however, rep. paul ryan of wisconsin argued too many questions remain unanswered to stop investigating whether politics played a role in the controversy.  ""what we still do not  know is who ordered this kind of targeting, why did it take so long for them to clean it up "" ryan, the   gop vice presidential nominee, told cbs.  asked if the claim of political motivation now seemed less valid, he responded  ""i do not  know the answer to that, so we are  going to let the facts take us where they take us.""  in particular, ryan said he wanted more details on why conservative oriented groups had their tax exempt applications stalled and experienced harassing behavior by the irs, such as having to answer inappropriate questions about the beliefs and activities of members.  at the same time, he sounded like pelosi in saying the bigger question involved the practice of targeting, rather than who specifically got targeted.  cnn poll  did white house order irs targeting   ""we know that the irs did target people based upon their political beliefs,"" ryan said. ""who cares whether they are  right or left  ... the fact that they are  targeting people for harassment based upon their political beliefs should be cause enough alone for outrage.""  thats a big change from inferences by gop leaders in recent weeks that the obama administration was likely behind the targeting that started in   in an effort to subdue political rivals.  with no evidence to date of any such connection, it was unclear how hard congressional committees would continue pushing the issue.  the gop led house ways and means committee has scheduled a hearing on thursday on an initial review of the irs targeting by the agencys temporary leader, daniel werfel.  president barack obama appointed werfel to clean up the irs mess last month after an inspector generals audit uncovered targeting of applications that contained conservative themed words such as ""tea party.""  the audit by treasury inspector general for tax administration j. russell george only cited the targeting of conservative groups, which it said ended in may  .  read irs watchdogs report  in his first substantive report on the agency, werfel said monday that its tax exempt unit used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax exempt applications until earlier this month, more than a year later than previously revealed.  the ""be on the lookout"" or bolo lists included liberal themed words such as ""progressives"" and other politically oriented terms such as ""occupy"" and ""medical marijuana"" in alerting irs workers to check for unacceptable political activities, according to copies made available by democratic rep. sander levin of michigan.  werfel said he has suspended the use of bolo lists in considering tax exempt applications for now.  a statement by levin questioned why georges audit focused only on bolo lists that contained conservative labels.  the inspector generals report ""served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations, and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way,"" levins statement said.  a spokesperson for george later responded that the report focused only on bolo criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax exempt status.  republicans have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration, an accusation denied by the white house and the irs.  mcconnell  obama administration a 'culture of intimidation'  in response to levins statement, house ways and means committee chairman rep. dave camp, r michigan, said the inclusion of ""progressives"" on a bolo list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector generals report.  the release of georges audit last month ignited a political firestorm in washington while fueling conservative mistrust of obamas administration as an example of big government gone wild.  werfel noted monday that his internal investigation, while still incomplete, found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by irs personnel or involvement by anyone outside the irs. he also said no evidence had emerged that in appropriate targeting extended into other areas of the agency.  five irs managers have been replaced, from the previous acting commissioner whom werfel succeeded to the head of the unit based in cincinnati that handles tax exempt applications.  in addition, werfel created an accountability review board to recommend within   days ""any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible"" for the targeting disclosed by the inspector generals report.  white house spokesman jay carney said monday that obama believes werfels report ""is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately, identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen, and takes a forward looking systemic view at the agencys management.""  in his audit that disclosed the misconduct, george said there was no evidence of a political motive. however, he is continuing to investigate the matter, along with the fbi and the congressional committees.  as part of his review, werfel said   groups awaiting irs action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than   days could self register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations.  at the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax exempt status. regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible.  confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the irs, werfel said.  an irs statement on monday said the ""safe harbor"" option for self certification would apply to groups that ""certify they devote    or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare.""  ""at the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves    or less of both their spending and time,"" the statement said. applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self certification, it said.  earlier  what is  a   c       werfel said the irs would continue checking on tax exempt groups to ensure they were following the law.  separately, the house oversight committee, which has been aggressively investigating the irs matter, plans to meet on friday to consider a resolution aimed at resolving questions about whether a key agency official must testify.  lois lerner was the director of exempt organizations when the agency filtered applications for tax exempt status. she appeared before the committee in may and said she had broken no laws or regulations and then invoked her constitutional right not to answer questions.  lerner pleads the  th  several committee republicans questioned whether she waived that right by making her opening statement, and oversight chairman darrell issa said she could be called back at a later date if that were the case.  cnns dana bash and deirdre walsh contributed to this report.",liberal and conservative groups seeking tax exempt status got targeted. pelosi  the priority is stopping political groups from getting tax breaks. ryan  unanswered questions require further questions. a house committee holds the next hearing on the issue thursday.

""the middle class is so funny, it is  the class i know best, and it is  the class where you find the most pretension.""  still, rowling clearly has an authorial eye for the preoccupations of her middle brow audience. britain can sometimes feel like a country in the midst of a permanent, low intensity class war in which all targets are fair game and all are left feeling routinely persecuted.  while the wealthy and privileged are derided as snobs and ""toffs,"" members of the working class are grotesquely parodied and vilified as illiterate ""chavs"" and the middle class is roundly mocked, often from within its own fragmented ranks, for its petit bourgeois obsessions with house prices, farmers' markets and amateur dramatics.  julian fellowes, the script writer behind lavish emmy nominated period saga ""downton abbey"" complained last year that ""poshism"" was the ""last acceptable form of prejudice"", while benedict cumberbatch, the well heeled star of ""sherlock"" said last month he had contemplated relocating his career to the american . because ""posh bashing"" in the uk had gone too far.  at the opposite extreme, owen jones, the author of ""chavs  the demonization of the working class,"" argued that the widespread blaming of last years riots in london and other cities on a supposed feral underclass was ""classic demonization, reducing complex social problems to supposed individual failings and behavioral faults.""  class, swearing and sex fill j.k. rowlings first adult book  if rowling needed any further evidence of the enduring power of issues of class and status to raise british heckles, it came last week in the blundering form of andrew mitchell, a senior member of prime minister david camerons cabinet, whose job as chief whip is still in the balance over whether or not, during an altercation with a policeman, he called the officer a ""pleb"" and suggested that he ought to ""learn his f       place.""  for critics of camerons government, mitchells alleged insult and the fact that, like the eton educated prime minister and many of his colleagues, he attended one of the american  elite fee paying public schools appeared to offer further proof of a blue blooded conspiracy to keep the proles firmly in their place.  as kevin maguire wrote in the mirror newspaper  ""in mitchells angry flash of social superiority ... we glimpsed the naked prejudice of the posh boys sitting at the cabinet table. the mask slipped to reveal how voters, the great british public, are viewed as inferior creatures, drones expected to know their place and tug a forelock at conservative rulers in their government castle.""  yet there are good reasons, aside from unvarnished prejudice, why class remains such a potent political issue. for those worst affected by the present governments austerity program, portrayed by opponents as an ideologically motivated assault on the founding principles of britains welfare state, the ""we are  all in it together"" mantra coined by british finance minister george osborne    the heir to a baronetcy and a multimillion dollar wallpaper fortune    understandably rings hollow.  class remains the single most important factor in shaping the life prospects of every single person born in britain;

" cnn on sunday, at almost the same moment that dozens of world leaders linked arms and led millions of people through the streets of paris to commemorate the   victims of last weeks terror attacks in france, explosives carried by two young girls ripped through a mobile phone market in the northeastern nigerian town of potiskum.  the blasts, which killed three people besides the bombers and injured   more, came just a day after another bomb, strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about   years old, exploded in a busy market in the city of maiduguri, killing at least   people.  while coming in widely divergent settings, thousands of miles apart, the attacks in france and nigeria were both motivated by an islamist extremist ideology that rejects a modern world shaped by political, economic, and social liberalism    and in the case of boko haram, whose name can be roughly translated as "" western  education is forbidden,"" also abhors scientific progress.  to achieve this end, no deed is too brutal or tactic too low, as is underscored both by the recent actions of boko haram and the posthumously posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near paris.  the difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the french victims and pledges of international solidarity for frances stand against violent extremism, nothing similar has been forthcoming for nigerias fight against the growing power of boko haram, at least not since the ephemeral and largely ineffectual global social media phenomenon of the  bringbackourgirls campaign last year. this is despite the fact that over the course of recent months, boko haram has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so called islamic state of iraq and syria, which has received so much attention.  in fact, as jamestown foundation terrorism analyst jacob zenn has pointed out, boko harams videos show a troubling convergence between the nigerian militants and their isis counterparts not only in terms of symbolism and ideology, but also insurgency doctrine.  boko haram leader abubakar shekau, for example, first expressed ""support"" for the isis caliph, abu bakr al baghdadi, this past summer. meanwhile, boko haram has added the jihadist black banner to its logo and the isis anthem to the musical repertoire on its videos. in one recent video, shekau even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own ""islamic caliphate"" and greeted his ""brothers"" in afghanistan, pakistan, somalia, and yemen, as well as ""the caliphate in iraq and syria.""  even more worrisome than boko harams extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the nigerian militants. alas, while it is largely ignored by american and european leaders and only sporadically covered by major media outlets, boko haram has been steadily gaining ground in its war against nigeria.  as i wrote several months ago, boko haram has, like isis, clearly moved beyond one off asymmetric attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the assimilation of increasingly large chunks of territory, successfully overrunning and now effectively controlling large portions of three states in northeastern nigeria    by some estimates, a total area larger than the netherlands, belgium, and luxembourg combined.  boko harams territorial base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks, like the past weekends suicide bombings, which regularly hit more than half a dozen other nigerian states as well as neighboring countries like niger, many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to al qaedas north african affiliate. nigers president mahamadou issoufou has even gone so far as to declare to the newsmagazine jeune afrique that ""the islamic state is at our door.""  by some estimates, more than  ,  people in nigeria alone have died as a result of boko haram related violence in  , while more than  .  million others have been displaced. just last week, the militants stormed baga on the shores of lake chad, one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands, reportedly killing more than  ,  civilians. moreover, the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities, in contrast with the demoralized nigerian military forces they square off against. in early september, for example, the group shot down a nigerian attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot, whom it later apparently beheaded, according to a video obtained by the associated press.  what makes the threat from boko haram all the more significant is the political and economic context of nigeria, africas most populous country and the largest economy on the continent.  the west african country is in the midst of a hotly contested general election, including a rematch presidential race between incumbent president goodluck jonathan and former military ruler muhammadu buhari, with votes to be cast just a month from now. no doubt boko haram, which rejects democratic politics along with other ""infidel"" ideas, will take advantage of the campaign and voting process to step up attacks. it is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote.  in paris on sunday, police and military forces fanned out across the french capital, meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for marchers. in nigeria, even if the country deployed every last soldier and policeman, it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its polling stations.  and, as if this were not bad enough, declining oil prices have slashed nigerian government revenues, substantially diminishing the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long running marginalization helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place.  it does, of course, go without saying that both the nigerian political class and its military, with all their attendant pathologies, bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in. but that fact alone should not absolve the international community of its obligation  and self interest  in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by boko haram    any more than legitimate concerns about generally lackluster leadership by french president franã§ois hollande and the french political elites failure to deal squarely with the potential for radicalization among segments of the countrys marginalized muslim population prevented world leaders from showing their support for france in recent days.  as the roman catholic archbishop of jos, nigeria, pleaded on the bbc recently, ""we need that spirit to be spread around...not just when it happens in europe, but when it happens in nigeria, in cameroon.""  in the struggle against islamist extremism and for peaceful coexistence and progress, it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a tale of two cities.","j. peter pham  boko haram makes significant territorial strides. its attacks show growing military sophistication, he says.

" cnn     when you think of gifs, those never ending sequences of looping motion, you are  more likely to associate them with lightly humorous viral content than a respectable art form.  however, their hypnotic movement has been gaining favor with the artistic community, and now one of the most high profile museums in the world, londons saatchi gallery, has teamed up with google+ to explore their more reflective side.  they gathered a roster of impressive judges, such as film director baz luhrmann, artists shezad dawood, tracey emin and cindy sherman, and saatchi gallery ceo nigel hurst, for the motion photography prize, the first global competition for artists working with animated gifs.  over  ,  people from   countries entered their work, which fitted into six categories   landscape, lifestyle, action, people, night and urban. the top gong went to a brooklyn based creative director christina rinaldi, whose mesmerizing gif of a new york city window cleaner, shown above, draws the viewers in with its almost trance inducing repetition.  cindy sherman, american photographer and film director, was attracted to the vibrancy of rinaldis work  ""it almost transcends the gif medium by turning the soapy water into brushstrokes, so it seems more like creating a painting,"" she explained.  rinaldi herself said that choosing motion rather than still photography was crucial to capturing the rhythm of the window cleaner at work  ""i was inspired by his brush strokes and the texture of the suds,"" she said,"" i watched him as if he were a performance artist    his work temporary and only to be witnessed within a few seconds. i quickly became enamored with his efficient rhythm. surviving in new york city requires an elevated sense of efficiency and an innate hustle.""  the work of other finalists    kostas agiannitis, micaãâ«l reynaud, matthew clarke, emma critchley and stefanie schneider, highlighted the diverse and creative nature of a gif as an art form.  ""there is incredible potential in this technology, and many photographers are now using gifs to create motion in their work"", says saatchi gallerys ceo and one of the judges nigel hurst.  ""you are  looking at an image that floats somewhere between a still photograph and film, it has elements of both but sometimes incorporated in an unexpected way, which makes it even more compelling,"" hurst says.  he added that the judging process was no different than when looking at other, more conventional, art  ""what stood out for us were images which were arresting, and used the parameters of the gif in an imaginative way.""  artist and illustrator clay rodery, whose work has appeared in the new york times, the atlantic and on hbo, initially started creating gifs to practice animation, but soon started making entire pieces for the format drawn by the chance to more eloquently express ideas he had inside his head.  he says "" first and foremost i am  conscious of it looping. its duration might be very short, sometimes only several frames, but in a loop there is the potential for its content to be endless.""  moreover, rodery says that gifs helped him develop as an artist  ""it most certainly has expanded the breadth of my work and its emotional impact. these days you need to work very hard to get your work to stand out, and a moving image really does wonders to get you noticed.""  the exhibition will be featured online on saatchi art, a web gallery for emerging artists.  too haute to handle   inside the worlds biggest furniture fair  korean artist creates fantasy worlds in her studio without photoshop  pimp my fish tank  this is the eerie, beautiful world of aquascaping",saatchi gallery has teamed up with google plus for the first gif art award. the motion photography prize went to brooklyn artist christina rinaldi. artists are increasingly looking to gifs as bona fide channels for self expression. 
" cnn     after a multi year odyssey marked by almost nonstop partisan bickering, cia employees hacking into senate intelligence committee computers, and former bush administration officials launching a pre emptive public counterattack against the committees report, we finally have a summary of the cias use of torture.  so what have we learned   the committee report confirms that six days after the  /  attacks, ""president george w. bush signed a covert action memorandum of notification  mon  to authorize the director of central intelligence  dci  to 'undertake operations designed to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to american . persons and interest or who are planning terrorist activities.'""  that decision put the cia on the path to revive and even expand coercive interrogation techniques it had employed during the cold war.  some key facts we already knew were confirmed, most importantly that agency personnel violated american . and international law by repeatedly waterboarding several detainees, including  /  attack mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed.  the summary of the report provides lurid details of "" "" like interrogation techniques, outlawed by international treaties to which the american . is a signatory  running power drills next to the heads of detainees, days of forced sleep deprivation and, in the words of the committee summary, ""threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee, and a threat to 'cut  a detainees  mothers throat.'""  the committee report summary also confirms what many have long believed    that the torture program produced no actionable intelligence and did not to thwart al qaedas global activities.  the former chief of the cias counterterrorism center and torture program participant jose rodriguez continues to claim that such intelligence was obtained, and that it did in fact save lives. the available record, as laid out by the committee, amply refutes that assertion.  and the committee summary could not be clearer about the actions of agency managers and attorneys in the expansion of the use of techniques that were clear violations of international law. according to the committee summary   "" ... by the end of november  , cia officers had begun researching potential legal defenses for using interrogation techniques that were considered torture by foreign governments and a non governmental organization."" cia director george tenet subsequently sent a letter to bush urging that the cia program be exempt from geneva convention prohibitions on the use of techniques defined by international law as torture.  whether as federal employees or political appointees, cia personnel took an oath to uphold the laws of the united states. instead, they chose to engage in acts that clearly violated those laws, including international treaties banning the use of torture to which the united states is not only a signatory, but a putative leader as well.  the response of multiple former intelligence community insiders who authorized or supported these programs is perfectly summed up in this quote from an anonymous former official offered to the daily beast earlier this week   ""it goes back to the one basic thing  whether they did right or they did wrong, they were told to do something, they did it, and they feel like they had the rug pulled out from underneath them.""  indeed, those cia attorneys and managers who signed off on waterboarding and other tactics had an affirmative obligation to refuse to authorize, much less participate in, a torture program. now, through de facto surrogates appearing on major media outlets and operating a website attempting to rewrite the history of this dark era, participants in the torture program claim they are the victims for simply following orders.  the defense of ""i was just following orders"" is never a winning one.  the use of mass surveillance and torture are the hallmarks of totalitarian governments. the united states has employed both since the september  ,  , attacks on our nation. while we have yet to renounce the former, the release of this senate intelligence committee torture report summary is a long overdue first step in renouncing the latter. lets hope it is  not the last step.","senate intelligence committee releases report on cia torture. patrick eddington  cia violated american . and international law. mass surveillance, torture are hallmarks of totalitarian governments, he says.

"venice, louisiana  cnn     a wind shift could push more oil from bps deepwater horizon gusher into the mississippi delta and areas west of the river, which is ""bad news for louisiana,"" gov. bobby jindal said monday afternoon.  louisiana has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded april   and sank two days later about   miles    kilometers  off the southeast coast of louisiana. the catastrophe is sending  ,  gallons of crude into the gulf of mexico each day. most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta.  ""we have  said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges,"" jindal said at a news conference.  he detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near grand isle to prevent the oil from reaching land.  national oceanic and atmospheric administration forecasters had warned over the weekend that the mississippi delta and areas to the northeast of it, including breton sound, chandeleur islands and the mainland behind them, could see oil hit the coast by tuesday.  further east, scientists were analyzing tar balls found on a beach on dauphin island, alabama, to determine whether they were caused by the oil spill, coast guard spokesman erik swanson said.  the tar balls are ""pieces of emulsified oil"" shaped like pancakes, ranging in size from dimes to golf balls, swanson said, adding they can sometimes occur naturally.  coast guard rear adm. mary landry confirmed the presence of tar balls in some areas, but said they were ""easy to clean up.""  she said booms were being moved toward grand isle in anticipation of oil reaching the area soon.  in addition to the use of dispersants on the surface and controlled burns, weather allowing, officials were carrying out a third test of sub sea dispersants to determine their impact, said landry. she said officials were trying to do in a few weeks what normally would take a few years.  so far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said mark j. musaus, deputy director of the southeast region for the american . fish and wildlife service. only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at fort jackson, louisiana, he said.  two of them, a gannet and a pelican, were released monday back into the wild. another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center, as was a green heron, he said.  the stakes are high for residents of coastal louisiana who make their living from fishing in the gulf of mexico.  the government has closed parts of the gulf to fishing. the affected area, which is east of the mississippi delta, comprises about  .  percent of the gulf of mexico, noaa said.  hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the gulf coastline.  thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the waters surface.  a bp executive said monday the energy company is working ""parallel paths"" to fix the oil well.  the failure over the weekend of a four story dome to cap the leak has led bp to move on to other options, including the use of a smaller chamber over the leak and shooting garbage into the gaping hole to try to plug the gusher, said doug suttles, bps chief operating officer for exploration and production.  the company also is considering placing a valve or a new blowout preventer on top of the existing one, which is not functioning as well as it should, suttles told cnns ""american morning"" program. as the name suggests, a blowout preventer is a device that is supposed to clamp shut over a leaking wellhead.  david nagel, executive vice president of bp america, said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe, limiting the gusher to  ,  barrels of oil a day.  ""we have a blowout preventer that we think is mostly shut,"" nagel said in an off camera briefing with reporters monday in washington, adding that the situation seems to be stable.  he said remote control inspection machines had not been able to check how the blowout assembly was working but ""something is constraining the leak"" from what would have been a flow estimated between  ,  to  ,  barrels a day.  suttles said bp is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe. ""what we are  going to do is keep developing options until we get this flow stopped,"" suttles said.  ""that started about a week ago,"" suttles said. ""that work continues. the well is at about  ,  feet.  ""about  ,  feet of that is the water depth. then the rest is drilling below the seafloor. we are  slightly ahead of plan here. these are complex tasks, but we are  making very good process.""  it may take up to three months to reach the target area, nagel said. and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes, he said.  ""the rock gets harder, and every time you have to replace a worn out drill bit, it takes more time to withdraw and stack the drill pipe,"" in   foot sections on the construction vessel to change the bit, re assemble the sections and lower the drill pipe back into action, said nagel.  on friday, bp lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points. but that plan was thwarted saturday after ice like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water blocked the top of the dome and made it buoyant.  bp has built the smaller dome and it is already available, suttles said monday. that device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming, suttles said. methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze.  called ""tophat,"" the   foot tall,   foot diameter structure weighs less than two tons. the structure is to be deployed this week by the drill ship enterprise, to which it is to be connected by two strings of pipe    one inside the other with a space in between for hot water, he said.  the process of stopping the gusher with garbage is called a ""junk shot."" under that procedure, debris such as shredded tires, golf balls and similar objects would be shot under extremely high pressure into the blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak.  that procedure would be done late next week, suttles said monday.  federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sunk the deepwater horizon, which was owned by bp contractor transocean ltd.  bp is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to    million. but florida sen. bill nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to    billion.  ""if this gusher continues for several months, it is  going to cover up the gulf coast and it is  going to get down into the loop current and thats going to take it down the florida keys and up the east coast of florida, and you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism, our beaches, to our fisheries, very possibly disruption of our military testing and training,"" nelson said sunday on cnns ""state of the union.""  bp has received  ,  claims for lost income and damages and   of those claims have been paid, at a price of   .  million, nagel said.  ""it is  a host of things,"" he said, ""the immediate loss of income is being handled very quickly.""  none of the payouts are for liability, but nagel stressed ""the interim plans are in no way meant to be final.""  also monday, organizers announced a ""gulf aid"" benefit concert for south louisiana fishermen and wetlands restoration.  the concert, to be held sunday, is slated to feature lenny kravitz, allen toussaint, mos def and the voice of the wetlands allstars featuring dr. john, cyril neville and tab benoit.  cnns paul courson contributed to this report.","louisiana has been mostly spared since oil rig exploded and sank off southeast coast. bp hit with  ,  claims for lost income and damages;   paid, to tune of   .  million. concert sunday to benefit south louisiana fishermen and wetlands restoration.

" cnn     president barack obama appeared on nbcs ""meet the press"" on sunday, talking about the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations and priorities for his administration in his second term.  the president told host david gregory that he was optimistic something will be worked out to keep tax rates from rising on tuesday    but if not, his first piece of legislation for the next congress will be a bill to reduce tax rates on most americans.  obama slams gop 'priority' as fiscal cliff hours away  the president also spoke about his second term and what he wants to accomplish. here are highlights of what he said   gun control after the newtown killings  ""something fundamental in america has to change,"" said obama, who visited on december   with families of victims of the newtown, connecticut, school shootings.  the president said sunday he will put forth a proposal next year to change firearm laws. among the things the legislation will address are assault style rifles, high capacity ammunition magazines and background checks on all firearm sales.  his comments echoed those made five days after the shootings in newtown, where a gunman killed his mother at home, then   children and six adults at an elementary school.  obama said he hopes that the newtown killings spur americans to take action and not let the shootings feel like ""one of those routine episodes,"" the emotions of which fade with memory.  """"it certainly wo not  feel like that to me. this is something that, you know, that was the worst day of my presidency,"" he said.  the president said he wanted to listen to all the parties involved in the gun control debate but was skeptical about the national rifle associations call to put armed guards in every school as the only solution.  obama said december   that a task force led by vice president joe biden will have legislative recommendations in january.  benghazi attack  obama said the security failures that led to the deaths of four americans at the american . consulate in benghazi, libya, were ""severe,"" but he blamed human mistakes.  ""there was just some sloppiness    not intentional    in terms of how we secure embassies in areas where you essentially do not  have governments that have a lot of capacity to protect those embassies,"" he said.  the state department will implement all of the   recommendations by a review board headed by veteran diplomat thomas pickering.  the fbi also has some ""very good leads"" into who carried out the september attack that killed american . ambassador j. christopher stevens and three others, obama said.  among the recommendations in the report sent to secretary of state hillary clinton were strengthening security, adding fire safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high threat areas.  ""but we will  try to do more than that,"" obama said.  u.n. ambassador susan rice  the president said verbal attacks on rice for her comments on the benghazi investigation were ""puzzling.""  ""of all the people in my national security team, she probably had the least to do with anything that happened in benghazi,"" he said.  rice said on sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online anti islam film.  she was heavily criticized for those statements, to the point that she withdrew her name from consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a ""lengthy, disruptive, and costly"" confirmation process. critics said rices comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism.  ""most americans recognize that these were largely politically motivated attacks as opposed to being justified,"" obama said.  next secretary of defense  he has yet to make a decision as to who to nominate for secretary of defense, obama said.  sources have said they think the president will pick chuck hagel, a republican, who has met with controversy since his name has been connected with the position.  gay rights groups, which were strong supporters of obamas election campaigns, have hit hagel for questioning in   whether a nominee for an ambassadorship was suitable because he was ""openly, aggressively gay.""  obama, without calling hagel his preferred candidate for the job, said  ""i have  served with chuck hagel  in the american . senate . i know him. he is a patriot. he is somebody who has done extraordinary work.""  hagel has apologized for those comments, obama said. he added that he did not  see anything in hagels political record that disqualified him as a potential nominee.  hagel currently is the co chairman of the presidents intelligence advisory board. leon panetta, who has been secretary of defense since july  , has indicated he wants to return to private life next year.  four issues for the next term  when asked about his priorities for the next four years, obama listed immigration, the economy, energy and debt reduction.  he will introduce legislation to fix a broken immigration system in  , he said.  ""we have talked about it long enough,"" he said. ""we know how we can fix it.""  obama also wants to fix americas infrastructure.  ""if we are putting people back to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, in part paid for by some of these broader long term deficit reduction measures that need to take place, that will grow our economy,"" he said  and he wants to increase further the amount of energy, especially green energy, that america produces.  ""we are producing more energy and america can become an energy exporter.  the question is  how do we do that in a way that also deals with the environmental challenges that we also have at the same time,"" obama said.  but the most pressing quandary is the fiscal cliff.  ""it is going to be very hard for the economy to sustain its current growth trends if suddenly we have a huge bite taken of the average americans paycheck,"" he said.","president speaks to nbc for nearly   minutes. interview covers subjects like taxes, security at foreign embassies, gun control. obama plans to introduce immigration legislation in next year. he thinks chuck hagel would be qualified to be next secretary of defense.

" cnn     miles away from the somber ceremony on a tarmac where coffins containing the remains of victims of flight mh  were returned, dozens of forensic scientists at a military base in the netherlands were preparing for the grim task of identifying the remains.  in all,   passengers and crew    among them dozens of children    were killed when the packed malaysia airlines boeing   they were on crashed in eastern ukraine last thursday.  all of the bodies and body parts recovered from the crash site will eventually be brought to hilversum, netherlands, where a team of experts from the dutch national forensics unit  landelijk team forensische opsporing  will do everything they can to return the dead to their loved ones.  ""you do not  know which nationality each body is,"" explains jos van roo of ltfo. ""so we try to identify all the bodies. we are in contact with the other countries to combine efforts to identify the bodies.""  the ltfo has experience of other mass disasters, having worked on the   asian tsunami, the crash of afriqiyah airways flight   in libya in   and other incidents in the netherlands.  van roo says great care has and will continue to be taken over the bodies, out of respect for the victims and to avoid any further distress to their families.  forensics specialist  'it must be very precise'  it is painstaking work, van roo says  ""there are lot of bodies and body parts coming our way. [everything] must be examined. ... it must be very precise. you must make sure you do not  give the wrong body to the wrong family.""  the teams work began days ago on the ukrainian field near the russian border where mh s journey from amsterdam to kuala lumpur came to a premature end.  forensic genetics expert denise syndercombe court of kings college london says some identifications will be relatively simple.  ""it sounds as if they have perhaps   body bags with identifiable bodies or parts of bodies in,"" she says. ""and while they have been at the site for some time, i would expect that it will be possible to get good dna profiles from most of those.""  in some cases, working out who is who may be even easier than that    if a victim has a distinctive scar or clothing, or even a wallet or passport in a pocket.  dental records can also be used to identify those who are not immediately recognizable.  if dna is needed, it is usually taken from an area of deep muscle. mitochondrial dna may also be used. in both cases, the experts will then need to compare the dna taken from the victim with a relative.  search for dna matches  but syndercombe court says the fact so many families died on flight mh  may complicate the process.  ""where you have lots of family members traveling together, you may have to rely on dna matches to more distant relatives,"" she explains. ""once you get beyond the immediate family, beyond grandparents or aunts and uncles, it becomes more difficult.""  in those cases, scientists may have to rely on alternative comparisons, matching dna from the remains to that found on toothbrushes or clothing owned by the dead person.  van roo says work has already begun to collect details and dna matches for those on board the plane, with dozens of detectives interviewing family members.  ""we have been working with the families of the victims. from them, we ask [for] a description of the victim, and we take dna, look at the dental records and take fingerprints,"" he told cnn, adding that the process of talking to relatives can take a long time.  ""you try to get as much information during your first visit. you do not  want to forget some questions. it is very painful to have to get back to families to ask [more] questions.""  ""every bit of information you get from a relative needs to be collected very carefully. also you need to take records from the bodies. it is a delicate procedure for example, [to] take dental records or dna.""  syndercombe court helped to identify the victims of yemenia flight  , which crashed into the indian ocean on its way from yemen to comoros in  , leaving   dead.  she says not every victim will be easy to put a name to  cases where the force of a blast or fire have damaged the remains can be complex.  and she says that while experts do have the passenger manifest, some cases may never be fully resolved.  but she hopes knowing, at least, that everything possible has been done, and that the remains were handled with great care will offer some solace.  ""the longer it goes on, the more difficult it can be. ... if someone is not found, or a body part is never identified, but it is dealt with in a sensitive way, the families know someone has gone to the effort, someone has tried their best.""  for the experts at hilversum, the next weeks and months will be busy and difficult. van roo says the work can be emotional, but everyone is united by their common aim.  ""we have the drive to give the bodies back to the families,"" he says. ""every case is unique, [but] you want to get the victim back. the drive stays the same.""  syndercombe court agrees  ""it is  a tough job, but a good job.  ""it is always grim, but we do it with the knowledge that we are helping someone else  the family want to be able to put it to bed, and we want to give them some peace.""  mh  tributes in moscow  'forgive us'  mother regrets hot heeding sons fears  cnns erin mclaughlin and antonia mortensen contributed to this report.","the remains of victims of flight mh  have been flown back to the netherlands. dozens of bodies collected from the crash site have been taken to kharkiv in the ukraine. dutch experts will use dna, dental records and fingerprints to identify the victims. the identification process can be lengthy but is aimed at giving families closure.

"los angeles, california  cnn     the transportation security administration said friday its officers at a texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings    one with pliers    but acknowledged the procedures should be changed.  the woman involved    mandi hamlin    told reporters earlier friday she was humiliated by last months incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male tsa officers nearby. the incident occurred at the lubbock, texas, airport.  the officers ""rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,"" the tsa said in a statement posted on its web site friday afternoon. ""tsa supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing lubbock that day.""  however, ""tsa has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed,"" the statement said. ""in the future, tsa will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question.""  hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney gloria allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect.  allred pointed out that tsas web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out    an option she said hamlin was never offered.  ""the conduct of tsa was cruel and united nations ecessary,"" allred told reporters at a news conference. ""last time that i checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon.""  she said if an apology was not forthcoming, ""mandi is going to have to consider her legal options.""  attempts by cnn to reach allred for a response to the tsa statement friday afternoon were american uccessful.  tsa said in its statement it acknowledges ""that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets  the  situation in which she found herself. we appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.""  the incident occurred february   as hamlin,  , was preparing to fly to dallas fort worth from lubbock, where she had been visiting her elderly great uncle.  hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport.  she did not set off the metal detector at lubbock international airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, allred said. a hand wand used by a tsa officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts.  hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.  ""ms. hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,"" allred said, reading from a letter she sent tsa. ""after nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. in addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.""  more officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female tsa officers, according to hamlin. also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. the officers insisted that hamlin remove the nipple rings, allred said.  ""she felt humiliated by the scene that the tsa officers were making,"" allred said.  ""with tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a tsa officer instead of having to remove them. she was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. had she been told that she had a right to a pat down, she would have chosen that option.""  she eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, allred said. one came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. she was handed a large pair, allred said.  ""as ms. hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male tsa officers snickering in the background,"" allred said in the letter.  ""mandi hamlin was publicly humiliated. ... clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.""  watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry â»  afterward, hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. she offered to remove it, allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, allred said.  ""i would not  wish this experience upon anyone,"" hamlin told reporters. ""i felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared. no one deserves to go through this.""  in a statement earlier friday, the tsa said it ""is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body. therefore, we have a duty to the american public to resolve any alarm that we discover.""  tsa included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a ""bra bomb"" in training and testing its officers.  hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted, and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed.  ""people who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment,"" allred said. ""they should be respected just like everybody else.""  she said she had received a call from tsas public affairs office friday morning. ""we hope that means they are  going to jump on this and do something about it,"" she said. ""we want tsa to do the right thing now. we are  going to give them the opportunity.""  hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the lubbock airport. the next time she visits her great uncle, she said, ""i will be driving."" email to a friend  cnns mike ahlers contributed to this report.",new  tsa backs officers who made passenger remove nipple rings. new  agency acknowledges that procedures need to be changed. agent using handheld metal detector at lubbock airport found piercings. woman says she heard male agents snicker as she removed rings.

" cnn     the small, world war ii era plane that crashed friday during a reno, nevada, air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why.  seven people, including the pilot, were killed when the plane crashed into spectators at the race, with two others later dying at area hospitals. close to   people were injured.  national transportation safety board member mark rosekind on sunday described this realization, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" it was also not entirely expected, given the size and nature of the p   aircraft.

" cnn     more than  ,  lives lost. a vast and unfolding humanitarian crisis. and the downing of a civilian airliner that shocked the world.  it is  hard to imagine    but true    that the raging conflict between ukraine and russia, or at least ukraine and pro russian rebels, all started with a humble trade agreement.  as tensions run high over a russian aid convoy described by western leaders as a provocative incursion, reports of direct russian military activity inside ukraine and ukrainian fears of an outright invasion, it is  time to look back on how we got here, and where things are headed   how it started  while the roots of the crisis run quite deep, what is  happening now began to unfold in earnest in the fall of  .  thats when then ukrainian president viktor yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the european union that would have pulled the country, so recently a satellite of the soviet union, toward europe in the latest twirl of a dance that has lasted centuries.  instead, yanukovych jumped at russian president vladimir putins offer to buy    billion in debt from his cash strapped government and cut the price of vital natural gas to the country.  yanukovychs decision set off protests in ukraines more europe leaning west calling for the governments ouster. security forces responded harshly, beating protesters and firing live ammunition into demonstrations, resulting in several deaths. as clashes spread, so did international anger over the situation.  by late february, yanukovych had fled to russia, the government had fallen and a new pro europe government had formed to replace it.  that, in turn, set off pro russian demonstrations in crimea, a semi autonomous ukrainian republic and the location of a major russian navy base.  after thousands of russian troops filtered into the territory    purportedly at the invitation of ukraines self exiled president    ukraines regional parliament called a referendum on secession, and before you could say ""borscht,"" crimea was part of russia.  and it is  here that things turned even uglier. pro russian fighters occupied government buildings in the countrys east, demanding a referendum on independence.  before long, rebel forces    believed to be supported by russia    had taken control of major cities in ukraines east. fighting broke out between the rebel groups and ukraines military, fighting that continues today.  in a major and likely inadvertent escalation in july, a suspected surface to air missile believed to have been operated by pro russian rebels shot down malaysia airlines flight  , killing all   people aboard and hardening western opinion, particularly in europe, against russia.  what is  happening now  ukraines military has been on the offensive recently against the pro russian forces, but those successes seem to have slowed.  russian troops remain camped along the ukrainian border, western leaders say.  and ukrainian officials said tuesday that they had detained   russian soldiers in the donetsk region of eastern ukraine, further evidence, kiev says, of direct russian involvement in the conflict.  meanwhile, the united nations has warned of a growing humanitarian crisis sure only to get worse unless something is done to stem the fighting.  what is  next  a full scale invasion is unlikely. while putins approval rating among russians is sky high, recent polling shows the russian people are not  wild about an out and out invasion of ukraine, said robert d. kaplan, the chief geopolitical analyst for stratfor.

" cnn     there are no easy answers when journalists have to decide how to cover a terrorist groups video.  the issue resurfaced tuesday when a member of the islamic extremist group isis was shown on camera beheading american journalist steven sotloff. no major news organization showed the gruesome conclusion of the isis video, but many did show screen grabs and short video clips of sotloff and the executioner, as well as another hostage that isis is threatening to kill.  the video is newsworthy    even if it also plays into the propagandistic hands of the people who produced it.  but a vocal flock of viewers and readers    and some fellow journalists    have deplored the decisions to show snippets of the video, reprising arguments that were made in august when news organizations showed screen grabs of james foley, another american journalist who was beheaded by isis.  ""ca not  believe this bears repeating, but one should not empower isis by publishing their pr materials,"" freelance journalist jeb boone wrote on twitter after the sotloff video emerged.  one major international broadcaster, al jazeera, said it had decided not to show any images of sotloff from the video    a more conservative position than other television networks. ""we suggest all media do the same,"" al jazeeras public relations account said via twitter, using the hashtag  isismediablackout.  not showing the video at all, however, risks sanitizing the grim reality of the world.  so most media outlets tried to strike a balance. isis ""would like us to show you the most graphic images on that video, as part of their campaign of terror. we will not,"" cbs news anchor charlie rose said as he introduced a segment about sotloffs death. instead, cbs showed only video clips from it.  media figures also tried to demonstrate some self awareness when dealing with the issue.  ""no way to avoid leading the show with isis butchery and yet, maddeningly, that also seems like what isis wants,"" chris hayes wrote on twitter before his   p.m. msnbc program.  newscasts tended to show more photos of sotloff in the field, reporting on stories throughout the middle east, than of him as a hostage. but screen grabs from the video were still widespread, including on cnns homepage and television networks.  the foley video surfaced on the social media website diaspora, as reported by insite, a blog on terrorism and extremism run by the site intelligence group. it was later put on youtube and promoted via twitter.  the sotloff video was discovered on an unidentified file sharing website by the site intelligence group, which researches terrorist threats. perhaps thats why social media reactions to the sotloff video were more muted    or perhaps, terribly, it is  because the shock value was diminished the second time around.","no major news organization showed the conclusion of the isis steven sotloff video. some viewers, readers and journalists have deplored decisions to show snippets of it.

"when harry returned home the morning after the typhoon struck, he found part of the roof missing from his home.  it was not  as bad as yolanda,"" he said, referring to typhoon haiyan, which completely destroyed his house in the magallanes ""barangay,"" or district, of tacloban a year ago. ""it was so scary.""  much of his barangay, which lies close to the waters edge, was decimated by the storm surge that was generated by the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in november,  . it is also one of the poorest areas in tacloban.  little more than a year on and most people in this traumatized town in the central philippines will be incredibly relieved that typhoon hagupit, which passed some   kilometers north, came with nothing like the force of haiyan. most of what has been rebuilt in the past few months has largely remained intact.  harry was one of many who heeded official warnings to evacuate to safer areas during the storm    he was not going to repeat the mistake he made last year of trying to ride it out.  surveying the damage around his modest home, its walls held up by various metal sheets and cardboard boxes, harry seemed remarkably positive  ""it is  not so bad."" pointing at the missing part of his ceiling above his living area and kitchen, he added  ""it was not nailed down as well as the other area of roof.""  he will  just repair it again like last time.  typhoon tracker  follow hagupit is  path  checking for damage  this was a typical scene across tacloban on sunday morning, as some  ,  people anxiously prepared to return to their homes from evacuation centers to check the damage.  according to the mayor and the citys disaster management authorities, there have so far been no casualties and power should be restored in the next day or so.  clearing up is more about mopping up; torrential rains drenched the entire area, flooding many roads. though the storm was nowhere near as powerful as last years, authorities took no chances and were prepared for what was to come.  our next stop was the santa nino church, a building that became symbolic of the damage done by haiyan. almost leveled completely, it was in the process of being renovated. hagupit spared it this time around    the only clues to what took place the night before were lots of tree branches and roots strewn around the surrounding streets.  still waiting for homes  many people in tacloban are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after haiyan. they have  been promised new homes but the process has been extremely slow.  for those lucky enough to get one, they are  often located miles away. they may be away from vulnerable, flood prone areas, but they are  also far from where they work, shops and their friends. these are the main reasons why many have chosen    against the wishes of the government    to rebuild their basic shanty homes in areas like magallanes and san jose.  yet some like lucrecia simbajon,  , another resident of magallanes, would jump at the chance of a new home if only she was offered one. she and her family are among hundreds who have spent the last few days camped out at the local roman catholic ""redemption"" church.  ""i do not  know how long i am  going to be here, as the roof was blown off my house last night,"" she said. her home     a typical wooden and metal shack     was wiped out last year. as a result, she spent more than   days at the redemption, lying between pews with her children. though it is easily the sturdiest building in the area, the churchs perforated roof is a reminder that haiyan spared little in its path.  simbajon does not  know how she will  carry out the repairs this time around. her house is located in an area declared a ""no build zone"" because it was so close to the coast and therefore vulnerable to storm surges. ""we need help from the government     financial assistance, materials, so we can rebuild,"" she said. they got no help after haiyan, she added. aside from delivering parcels of rice and noodles, she said no one from the government had been near over the past few days.  asked if she would  consider one of the new houses the local government pledged to build in the wake of haiyan, she was emphatic  ""we no longer have a home here. for my family we are willing to move, to transfer.""  sheltering in chapel  the atmosphere inside the main chapel at the redemption was far calmer than a day earlier when everyone nervously awaited the arrival of hagupit    these were among the towns poorest and most vulnerable. a white board listed everyone who was evacuated here, including several heavily pregnant women.  alita castillo, another local, is also a volunteer with a local ngo dealing with disaster risk reduction. her entire family is staying in an adjacent hall. ""we are  more prepared this year, with more people prepared to leave their houses,"" she said. ""last year, we had   families staying with us in the church. this time we have more than  .""  yet she and her family still do not  have a house, more than a year after haiyan. and now the house she had been staying in has been badly damaged.

" cnn     the first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year. and more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said wednesday.  the increase in attacks has forced many countries to patrol pirate hotspots such as the gulf of aden.  ""the increased activity in somalia is the major reason for the spike,"" said cyrus mody, manager of the international maritime bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.  from january   until september  , pirates worldwide mounted   attacks, compared with   in all of  , the bureau said.  of the incidents this year, somali pirates accounted for   percent  they launched   attacks.  most of them took place off the east coast of somalia and in the gulf of aden, a major shipping route between yemen and somalia.  they successfully hijacked   vessels and took   hostages. eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the bureau said.  somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with   crew members as hostages.  somalias transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates    many of whom are based in the port cities.  this has prompted europe and other western countries to step up maritime patrols.  ""in the gulf of aden, the number of attacks have gone up. but because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased,"" mody said. ""the navies are responding very very effectively.""  todays pirates are a far cry from the eye patched, peg legged swashbucklers of hollywood. they don night vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices.  many pirates are trained fighters; others are young thugs enlisted for the job. experts say they often sail out to sea in a mother ship and wait for a target.  when they find one, the pirates board smaller boats and move in, typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat.  two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy  access and opportunity.  as global commerce picks up, more and more of the worlds fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship. ninety five percent of americas foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the american . maritime administration.  that cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as somalia.  those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in somalia in the  s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the somali coast.  piracy accelerated after the fall of the somali government in the early  s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms.  those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions.  with the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to   ,  a year, analysts say. thats a fortune for someone from an impoverished country.  some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies.  ""yes, the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant. but at the same time, from the owners point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo,"" mody said.  ""it is  basically a cycle.""  other trouble spots this year were waters off nigeria, with   attacks; malaysia with  ; and bangladesh with  .","somali pirates accounted for   percent of all attacks this year. most of them took place off east coast of somalia and in gulf of aden. somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom. other trouble spots were waters off nigeria, malaysia and bangladesh.
