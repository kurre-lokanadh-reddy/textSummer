# textSummer (not maintained)
A python based text sumemrization project which includes 5 state-of-the-art extractive algorithems (page rank,LSA,Luhn,Embedding,feature based ,and  own hybrid model) the hybrid model is a combination of LSA and Embeddings which is more effective over the texts which are of more than 2 particular topics. The models are developed from scratch in python using minimal packages in the processes. 

#A hybrid text summerization model based on the concept of LSA and Embeddings which performs better then the regular LSA when the source text is around more than 1 topic of conversation.


This project only uses packages like nltk, numpy to process the background, all the models are done from scratch and if U have any suggestions or improvements feel free to contact me.
The repo majorProject covers the models that are done using the package like spacy, gensim etc.
